Review main section:
- XTC classic, so many examples of great songwriting.
- Tracks 8 and 9 I'm not too fond of. But apart from that, every song on this album is a joy to listen to.
- One of XTC's most well-known songs is on this album - [15] Dear God. It's not XTC's usual style of song, most of their songs are upbeat and energetic, whereas this one is a bit more sombre and dark. The music video is great though:
