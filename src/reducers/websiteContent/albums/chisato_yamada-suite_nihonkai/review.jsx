                Japanese tsugaru-jamisen musician Chisato Yamanda created one of the best fusions of Japanese funk and Min'y≈ç music I've ever heard in my life!
                This is so underrated and underappreciated in the modern era.
                It's authentically Japanese and incredibly unique in its combination of genres and instrumentaiton -

                <b>Shamisen (plucked string instrument)</b> + <b>grand orchestral production</b> + <b>funky vibes</b> + <b>field recordings of wind</b>.

                The Third Movement, The Fourth Movement, and Tsugaru Spring Song is legitmatley one of my favourite 3 track runs in any album, EVER!!! 
                Tsugaru Spring Song in particular is amazing. 
                And the epic harmonised vocals being introduced at in the Third Movement begins this amazing run of musical splendour.

                There's a wonderful sense of musicianship that I sense whenever I listen to this album. 
                Everything just works. I have rarely any criticims of this album, I think almost every song flow perfectly and the variety of instrumentation is a delectable splendour you should give your ears the chance. 
                Honestly the only song I'm a bit meh on is The First Movement, the intro to the album. But this is because the album develops at its own pace, gradually introducing new layers of instrumentation and production, which is part of its charm in my opinion.
