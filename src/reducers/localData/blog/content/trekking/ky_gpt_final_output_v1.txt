<p>This was one of the most insane things I’ve ever done in my life. And strangely, I feel compelled to do more 6000m summits in the future.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Total distance = 108km</li>
  <li>Total elevation gain = 6000m</li>
  <li>Max altitude = 6200m (Kang Yatze II summit)</li>
  <li>Type = Camping</li>
  <li>Duration = 10 days</li>
  <li>Agency: Ju-Leh adventures</li>
  <li>Guide: Jit</li>
  <li>With: Giovanni, Maria, Patrick, Helene</li>
</ul>

<h3>Day 1 - 13/08/2024</h3>
<p>Zingchen (3402m) – Rumbak (3956m)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distance = 5.14km</li>
  <li>Ascent = 397m</li>
  <li>Steps = </li>
  <li>Duration = 1.5 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>We met in the Ju-Leh adventures office, in the Leh town centre – the office was a bit tricky to find but got there eventually. Giovanni works in construction, building bridges etc… Maria works in environmental science, they both live in Rome. Helene works in a school, and Patrick works for a sport clothing brand, they both live in Strausberg.</p>

<p>I was informed that the crampons required for summit day would not fit on my chosen shoes (Salomon speedcross 6 GTX). I had to rent these humongous ski boots (2.5kg each boot). I was immediately a bit nervous about the challenges that lay ahead…</p>

<p>We got a 1 hour jeep to the start of the trek – Zingchen – and then started walking! It felt pretty hot, however, at high altitudes, the temperature your body feels can be deceiving. The UV index is higher it can seem much hotter than it really is. This is more obvious when the sun goes down, or you find some shade (more on this later…)</p>

<p>Day 1 was a relatively easy day, we got to our camp site by around 2pm. I wasn’t expecting it but every day Tamil (our chef) prepared amazing lunch boxes for us full of great food – mangos, chapati veg wrap, potatoes, boiled eggs, cheese, guava juice, and chocolate.</p>

<p>This was topped even further by a fantastic dinner. The food they can conjure up despite being far from civilization is very impressive.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, on day 1, I had already made a fatal mistake. Prior to dinner, I was organising my big bag. I got the call for food, and left my bag outside. After food, maybe 7pm’ish, I returned to my tent, picked up my big bag and chucked it inside my tent. I then turned off my headtorch (to prevent insects following me), shuffled inside my tent, and switched my headtorch back on, and there was an extremely unpleasant sight – about 20 spiders crawling up onto the walls of the tent having been attached to my big bag outside! They were not small spiders either, relatively big ones with thin legs and a big face.</p>

<p>I panicked and didn’t know what to do, I wanted to get out but that would risk further contamination now that I’d already closed the tent. So I got into my sleeping bag and hid my entire body leaving my head poking out, grabbed my shoe, and gently pushed the side of the tent whenever a spider crawled in that direction, and the spider would fall on the ground I smashed it with my shoe… I did this at least 20 times… This ended up taking about 1.5 hours of my life… I never made the same mistake again. Quite an introduction to the Ladakhi entomology! The closest comparison I can make is the scene in Harry Potter with all the spiders in the forest…</p>

<h3>Day 2 – 14/08/2024</h3>
<p>Rumbak (3956m) – Stok La base camp (4438m) – Yurutse (4148m)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distance = 12.89km</li>
  <li>Ascent = 864m</li>
  <li>Duration = 4 hours</li>
  <li>Steps = </li>
</ul>

<p>Today we walked to Stok La base camp, a slow gentle incline. Then back to Rumbak, and then to Yurutse for our campsite. The views were immense and vast. I did not make the same spider mistake as last time… We had an amazing view of the Stok Kangri mountain (6100m) from our campsite.</p>

<h3>Day 3 – 15/08/2024</h3>
<p>Yurutse (4148m) – Ganda La pass (4961m) – Skiu (3366m)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distance = 20.43km</li>
  <li>Ascent = 916m</li>
  <li>Duration = 6 hours</li>
  <li>Steps = </li>
</ul>

<p>Today we departed from our wonderful campsite at Yurutse, all the way up to Ganda La pass at 4961m ! Once I was above 4167m every second was a new PB for me! I even went up a little higher to 5000m just for fun! Then we embarked on a long gradual decline all the way back down to Skiu (near Markha valley) at 3366m altitude. Once again our campsite was pretty fantastic.</p>

<h3>Day 4 – 16/08/2024</h3>
<p>Skiu (3366m) – Markha (3760m)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distance = 20.19km</li>
  <li>Ascent = 526m</li>
  <li>Duration = 4.5 hours</li>
  <li>Steps = </li>
</ul>

<p>Today was a gradual incline up to Markha, fully in the midst of the well trodden Markha valley. Unfortunately, I made another mistake… This was really stupid… I filled up my water bottles from the glacial water pipes because I saw all the Ladakhi and Nepali assistants doing it too… This is fine for foreigners if you add a water purification tablet… However I didn’t do this… Which was really stupid, because I started to feel progressively more and more sick from this point on.</p>

<h3>Day 5 - 17/08/2024</h3>
<p>Markha (3760m) – Tachungtse (4376m)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distance = 16.09km</li>
  <li>Ascent = 606m</li>
  <li>Duration = 4 hours</li>
  <li>Steps = </li>
</ul>

<p>I felt fine for the 1st half of the day. And then started to feel sick around lunch time. Felt a bit better once we moved again, but then struggled to eat food at dinner time at Tachungtse campsite…</p>

<h3>Day 6 - 18/08/2024</h3>
<p>Tachungtse (4376m) – Kang Yatze base camp (5130m)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distance = 6.27km</li>
  <li>Ascent = 827m</li>
  <li>Duration = 2 hours</li>
  <li>Steps = </li>
</ul>

<p>Today is a pivotal day, we arrived at Kang Yatze base camp at 5130m altitude! We spent a total of 3 nights camping here, which is quite a special experience. I felt like I was going to die every second today, I felt so ill. I wasn’t eating much food at all at this point. My stomach felt very compressed. My eating pace was extremely slow, which I hate because I love food, but I think the unpurified water had messed with my digestive system in some way. Just powering through by human will power and admiring the exceptional views and vast landscapes. But it is more challenging when I’m not consuming as many carbohydrates as I’d like to consume. Plus walking at these high altitudes is noticeably difficult if you’ve not done it much. Kang Yatze base camp is the highest altitude I’ve ever been in my life. Also, squatting to do a shit every day is obviously pretty hard after doing lots of walking already, so another added challenge.</p>

<h3>Day 7 - 19/08/2024</h3>
<p>Acclimatization day (2 hour walk above base camp)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distance = 2.93km</li>
  <li>Ascent = 187m</li>
  <li>Duration = 1 hour</li>
  <li>Steps = </li>
</ul>

<p>Today we had the privilege of waking up at 8am! From what I recall, changing from standing up to sitting down was very taxing on my stomach.</p>

<h3>Day 8 - 20/08/2024</h3>
<p>Kang Yatze II summit day!</p>
<p>The most insanely difficult, exhausting, 12 hours of my life. The immense solitude, vast beauty of the Himalayas, and immersion with Ladakhi culture is something every human should experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distance = 9km (doesn't sound like much!)</li>
  <li>Ascent = 1020m (doesn't sound like much either!)</li>
  <li>Duration = 12 hours (now that is a lot)</li>
</ul>

<p>So what made walking 9km up 1020m so difficult? Snow!</p>

<h3>Timeline of events:</h3>
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------
- 12am: woke up (that's 7:30pm UK time)
- 1am: started walking, with literally 0 hours sleep, a stomach infection, and lack of food because my stomach felt awful, 2 5kg ski boots stuffed into my backpack, metal crampons, and lots of layers since it was rather chilly. We began with 4 hours of zig-zag pathways in darkness lit by headtorches.
- 4am: arrived at crampon point, and had to put my beloved Salomon trail shoes in my bag in exchange for the very heavy ski boots, attach the metal crampons, attach the harness and rope, and have the ice axe at the ready. None of this would have been possible without the fantastic Nepali guides and assistants with us. On the one hand I was glad to reduce the weight of my backpack, however what followed was 5 hours of excruciating difficulty, slowly climbing up a vertical wall of snow to 6200m altitude in -10°c temperature, ice axe in one hand, clinging onto the rope for safety on the other hand. We started ascending the snow in brutally cold darkness, eventually we saw the sunrise after about 1 hour, it was a big relief to have bright sunshine greet us at 5am, which helped to warm us up a lot. (It's now approximately midnight UK time)
- 8:22am: Despite the odds, we arrived at the summit of Kang Yatze II !!!!! (It's now approximately 4am UK time) We were extremely lucky in terms of visibility, as the previous 3 days we'd been observing Kang Yatze II from base camp it had been surrounded by clouds, thick layers of fog, rain, and persistent hail storms. I can't imagine how much harder the climb would have been had it been raining, hailing, surrounded by fog with no Himalayan mountains to gaze at every time you're out of breath from climbing up the snow.
- 9am: 2 hours of extreme difficulty descending the thick snow. It was so hard to maintain any sort of stability of grip whilst descending. It was only until descending that I realised how exhausted I was.
- 11am: eventually we returned to crampon point, and finally I could take off the crampons and ski boots. Then followed 2 hours descending the rocky zig-zag pathways I barely recall doing 7 hours ago at 1am.
- 1pm: returned to base camp. Slept for 6 hours.
- 7pm: dinner
- 8pm: slept for 10 hours
- 6am: woke up the next day (day 9) with a lot of returned energy
</pre>

<h3>Day 9 – 20/08/2024</h3>
<p>Kang Yatze base camp (5130m) – Kongmaru La pass (5260m) – Chogdo (3905m)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distance = 15.02km</li>
  <li>Ascent = 529m</li>
  <li>Duration = 5 hours</li>
  <li>Steps = </li>
</ul>

<p>So, like I said, I slept for a total of 16 hours after the summit… And I actually woke up feeling fantastic, and surprisingly ate a bit more food, and my legs felt energetic again! I packed my tent away for the final time at Kang Yatze base camp (5045m), and departed for a 15km walk (going up to 5400m, and descending all the way down to 3900m).</p>

<p>We eventually arrived at a very cozy homestay in a tiny little Ladakhi town called Chogdo. There were about 6 houses here. But every house was full of personality, crazy kids running around, and it was quite an amazing feeling to spend a night in a “normal” bed again, after 9 nights of sleeping on rocky floors, and despite all the camping equipment you bring with you on these types of adventures, it never quite compares to the comfort of a “normal” bed. It’s moments like these, adventures like these, that make you truly appreciate the little things in life, things that many people cannot afford.</p>

<h3>Day 10</h3>
<p>Today we were picked up from Chogdo, and within 2 hours we were back in civilization! I had mobile signal again, my Garmin was synchronising my activities one by one, I was catching up with the news and football scores and youtube videos I had missed, etc… So much stuff that happened just within 9 days, it makes you wonder what the hell am I doing with my time when I’m not disconnected from civilization in the comfort of a home!</p>

<p>We visited two incredible Buddhist monasteries today. Thiksey monastery, and Spituk monastery. There are some pretty strict rules about not taking photos inside… But I was a rebel and just had to capture the immense artistic beauty of what is inside these sacred monasteries… Sorry Mr. Buddha.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Total distance = 108km</li>
  <li>Total ascent = 6000m</li>
</ul>

<p>I am familiar with these kinds of numbers when it comes to multi-day treks, so the struggle of the trek wasn't down to the duration or distance covered, I'm happy to walk 40+km daily, but the struggles lay in…</p>

<ul>
  <li>The reality of camping in remote areas</li>
  <li>Not a massive amount of high altitude experience</li>
  <li>Stomach infection</li>
  <li>Lack of sleep on summit day</li>
  <li>Lack of carbs from day 4 onwards due to stomach infection preventing me from eating</li>
  <li>Walking in snow in unfamiliar ski boots with metal crampons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite my detailed summary, I still feel I have not done justice to the insanity that was this whole experience, and the summit day in particular. There is no way to describe the feeling of these 12 hours. A photo simply doesn't capture the spirit of high altitude trekking. It must simply be experienced.</p>

<p>Again this wouldn't have been possible without the wonderful Nepali guide Jit, and all the amazingly talented and kind Nepali assistants (Sabiz), the awesome chef (Tamil, who I had to apologise to for not eating much of his delicious food), and of course the local Ladakhi horses who carried some of our gear and tents. What I find most incredible is that all of these great people do this every week of their life's - literally the day we got back to Leh, our guide Jit was meeting his next group of travellers who are doing the same 10-day trek as us! I'm currently writing this on the 24th, 3 days after returning now, so Jit's new trekking group will be on day 3 already now!! What a life!</p>

<p>Giovanni, Maria (Italy), and Patrick, Helen (France), were perfect trekking buddies to be alongside for the whole 10 days. Very generous, kind, funny, modest travellers with lots of interesting life experience to share.</p>

<p>I think every summer I would like to try a new 6000m peak, maybe do this for a few years, and perhaps one day a 7000m peak!</p>

<h3>Lessons learned:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Never leave your bag on the grass overnight. It will get covered in spiders.</li>
  <li>Only need to carry 2 water bottles on you, assuming there is consistent water flow. Just make sure to use the purification tablets!</li>
</ul>
