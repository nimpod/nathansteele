Review intro:
Some of the most mesmerising ambient music I have ever heard.
I debated for a long time whether this album feels like a 10 or not... And then I realised every time I put this album on I always end up listening to the entire thing. There isn't a single track that feels out of place.
I remember the exact moment I heard this album for the first time - I was wondering around Heathrow airport on the 2nd August 2024, waiting for my delayed flight - and suddenly 4:02 started playing on my shuffled ambient receomdnations playlist. It transported me to an entirely different world the moment I started listening to this album.
Personally for me, it signified the beginning of a new journey in my life. Since the 2nd August 2024, this album has become one of my 10 most listened albums of all time in less than 6 months.
Every sound on this album is absolute perfection. It's not just ambient music. It's music that pierces the soul deeply, placing the mind a truly meditiative state.
Everytime I listen to this album, I feel like I'm exploring a desolate landscape, devoid of materialism, appreciating the vastness of where we come from and who we are.
In case you hadn't noticed, the name of each track on this album corresponds to the length.
Global Communication are an electronic duo consisting of Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton. The duo (and Mark himself) have a vast discography not available on Spotify. You will have to scour the depths of youtube and torrents to discover their other music. This one album of theirs seems to have maintained it's place on streaming platforms, which can be considered a good thing because everyone should have the opportunity to listen to this beautiful music.
