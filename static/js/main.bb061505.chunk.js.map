Given the technology available at the time, and the extremely\r\n                hostile conditions on Venus, the fact that we got any data back, let alone pictures and audio recordings from another planet, is a remarkable <b>feat of engineering\r\n                and science</b>.

It's not sci-fi, it's real, and I believe the Russians deserve more love and respect for\r\n                their engineering and discoveries. This precious data remains one of the most profound realizations of extreme environments on other planets - one of only 6 worlds we have successfully\r\n                placed landers on (Venus (1966), our Moon (1969), Mars (1976), Titan (2004), P67 comet (2015)).</p>\r\n            <p>Whilst it's entirely speculative, Venus may once have been Earth-like. Perhaps 300 million years ago Venus could have had similar conditions to current Earth. Perhaps the fate of future\r\n                Earth is similar to that of Venus's scorching hellscape - covered in volcanos, inconceivably high surface temperatures, and an almost impenetrable

What unbelievable cosmic events will I miss out on outside of my lifetime? I believe that we should not feel small, \r\n                insignificant, unimportant or pointless. Instead, we should thank our eyes, our brain, our body and our own silent companion throughout our life for allowing you consciousness\r\n                at such an extraordinary time period where we can study the mysteries of the universe and observe things that are incomprehensibly far away. \r\n                We too as human beings are made up of the same stuff as galaxies - we are just a particular arrangment of atoms that somehow results in consciouness and an understanding of \r\n                our place in the universe.

Whilst listening to this mix several times, this one song stood out to me, it was different from any other style of music I'd heard it before, it was dense and atmospheric and creepy. Eventually I decided to delve deeper into the discography of Boards of Canada, and everything changed when I stumbled upon their 1998 album \"Music Has The Right To Children\". </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*}\r\n        <div className='review-favTracks'>\r\n            <p className=\"review-section-subtitle\"># favourite tracks</p>\r\n            <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1XZdwzd8DTDvkjVc0eJ9BI?utm_source=generator&theme=0\" \r\n                title=\"Spotify\"\r\n                width=\"100%\" \r\n                height=\"152\" \r\n                frameBorder=\"0\" \r\n                allowFullScreen=\"\" \r\n                allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" \r\n                loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        */}\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const review = () => (\r\n    <div className='review-content'>\r\n        <div className=\"review-meRambling\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                Why the fuck are more people not listening to this. Japanese tsugaru-jamisen musician Chisato Yamanda created one of the best fusions of Japanese funk and Min'yō music I've ever heard in my life! This is so fucking underrated and underappreciated in the modern era! \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                This album is authentically Japanese and incredibly unique in its combination of genres and instrumentaiton - Shamisen (plucked string instrument), grand orchestral production, funky shamisen jams, the sound of wind. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The Third Movement, The Fourth Movement, and Tsugaru Spring Song is legitmatley one of my favourite 3 track runs in any album, EVER!!! Tsugaru Spring Song in particular is amazing. And the epic harmonised vocals being introduced at in the Third Movement begins this amazing run of musical splendour. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                There's a wonderful sense of musicianship that I sense whenever I listen to this album. Everything just works. I have rarely any criticims of this album, I think almost every song flow perfectly and the variety of instrumentation is a delectable splendour you should give your ears the chance. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Honestly the only song I'm a bit meh on is The First Movement, the intro to the album. But this is because the album develops at its own pace, gradually introducing new layers of instrumentation and production, which is part of its charm in my opinion. \r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React  from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst IMAGES = {\r\n    Enceladus: require('./photos/Enceladus.jpg'),\r\n    Encealdus_geysers: require('./photos/Enceladus_geysers.jpg'),\r\n    an_enceladus_rise: require('./photos/an_Enceladus_rise.png'),\r\n    huygens_lander_descent: require('./photos/huygens_lander_descent.jpg'),\r\n    huygens_lander_Titan_surface: require('./photos/huygens_lander_Titan_surface.jpg'),\r\n    jwst_photo_of_Titan: require('./photos/jwst_photo_of_Titan.webp'),\r\n\r\n    // diagrams...\r\n    titan_map: require('./diagrams/Titan_map.jpg'),\r\n    titan_map2: require('./diagrams/Titan_map2.jpg'),\r\n    cassini_huygens_mission_summary: require('./diagrams/cassini_huygens_mission_summary.png'),\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const post = () => (\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div className='intro-text blog-subsection' id='section1'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>Intro</h3>\r\n            <p>NASA's space-research mission <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/'>Cassini-Huygens</a> (named after Italian Astronmer <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini'>Giovanni Cassini</a>, and Dutch\r\n                Astronomer <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens'>Christiaan Huygens</a>) embarked on an epic 7 year voyage to Saturn.\r\n                It was launched in <b>1997</b>, arrived 7 years later, and remained active for another 13 years, with the mission ending in dramatic fashion in <b>2017</b>.\r\n                The spacecraft made many profound discoveries, completely changing our understanding of solar system formation, planet evolution, moons, etc...\r\n            </p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img className='larger-image' width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src={IMAGES.cassini_huygens_mission_summary} alt='Infographic of Cassini-Huygens 7 year journey from Earth to Saturn' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='section2'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>Huygens Titan lander</h3>\r\n            <p>The 'Huygens' part of the mission was the lander, which touched down on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)'>Titan</a> (the largest of Saturn's 83 moons) on July 1st 2004, shortly after the spacecraft arrived at Saturn.</p>\r\n            <p>Remarkably, we have <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svmGxFaGILY'>video footage</a> of the lander descending for onto the surface of Titan for 2h 27m!!!!

Organic compounds are produced by ultraviolet radiation in the atmosphere, and the rain deposits all these compounds onto the surface forming the lakes. There is no reason\r\n                why complex organic chemistry that gives rise to bacterial life could not emerge in this atmosphere.</p>\r\n            <p>Titan is thought to be a prebiotic environment rich in complex organic chemistry. It has been suggested that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water. \r\n                Such organisms would inhale H2 in place of O2, metabolize it with acetylene instead of glucose, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.</p>\r\n            <p>Titan is also home to cryovolcanoes, which also contribute to adding methane to the atmosphere.</p>\r\n            <p>On Titan, the little sunlight it gets allows only about one centimeter of evaporation per year (versus one meter of water on Earth), but the atmosphere can hold the equivalent of about 10 meters of liquid before rain \r\n                forms (versus about 2 cm on Earth). So Titan's weather is expected to feature downpours of several meters causing flash floods, interspersed by decades or centuries of drought (whereas typical weather on Earth\r\n                includes a little rain most weeks). Cassini has observed equatorial rainstorms only once since 2004. Despite this, a number of long-standing tropical hydrocarbon lakes were unexpectedly discovered in 2012.\r\n                This may explain the reason for the strange reappearance and disappearance of small islands which Cassini saw happening.</p>\r\n            <p>Huygens Titan lander remains the most distant landing of any human made spacecraft EVER.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src={IMAGES.titan_map} alt=\"Map of Titan\" />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <h5 className='subgroup-title'>Returning to Titan?</h5>\r\n            <p>There has been a mission proposed called the <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/content/titan-submarine-exploring-the-depths-of-kraken/'>Titan Mare Explorer</a> to send a submarine-like lander to investigate these mysterious Titanian lakes in more detail.</p>\r\n            <p>The lake of particular interest is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_Mare'>Kraken Mare</a>.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"300\" height=\"400\" className='dont-resize' src={IMAGES.jwst_photo_of_Titan} alt='Titan imaged by the James Webb Space Telescope' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <h5 className='subgroup-title'>The far future of Titan</h5> \r\n            <p>Unfortunately it's probably too cold on the surface for life as we know it to emerge.

This method was chosen because...</p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li>1) It is imperative to ensure protection and prevent biological contamination to any of the moons of Saturn thought to offer potential habitability.</li>\r\n                <li>2) It's a unique opportunity to gather data about Saturn's gravity and magnetic fields.</li>\r\n                <li>3) As I said, Cassini was low on rocket fuel.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n                When Cassini began it's grand finale and took its first dive into Saturn's atmosphere, it was 1900 miles above the top of Saturn's clouds, and was able to transmit stunning \r\n                images of Saturn's atmosphere.

Because there is only an extremely thin atmosphere on the Moon,the sky appears black.</p>\r\n                <p>In addition, sunlight at the Moon's surface was incomparably strong with the starlight; the stars simply faded in comparison with the sun.</p>\r\n                <p>If the astronauts used sufficiently long exposures, stars would, indeed, be visible.</p>\r\n                <p>There are no stars because the cameras couldn't pick them up. And like I mentioned before, considering that it is 1969, there are a lot of limitations on the ability to carry out documentation in the form of photo/video media.</p>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.2) But the flag is waving?</h3>\r\n                <p>The flag was actually made from plastic material, similar to the one that tents are usually made of.</p>\r\n                <p>For practical reasons, the flag was originally folded to maximize space and stored in a thin tube.</p>\r\n                <p>After Neil Armstrong planted it to the surface of the Moon, it briefly appeared to move as it was unfolding itself to its final shape.</p>\r\n                <p>I like to imagine the flag as tinfoil, try and make a nice flat piece of tinfoil!</p>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.3) But they passed through the Van Allen Radiation Belt?</h3>\r\n                <p>The truth is, during their entire voyage to the Moon and back to Earth, Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins only received amount of radiation equal to about 0.1% of the deadly dose.</p>\r\n                <p>Their total exposure was approximately 11 milisieverts. Lethal levels of radiation is around 8,000 millisieverts.</p>\r\n                <p>The harmful effects of radiation are based both on its strength and the time of exposure to its source.</p>\r\n                <p>Average human would need to spend nearly four months inside the Van Allen belts to accumulate a lethal dose.</p>\r\n                <p>The astronauts managed to pass through them during less than one hour.</p>\r\n                <p>Regarding the time spent out of Earth's magnetic field, where the astronauts were exposed to solar radiation, an average human could endure a radiation exposure equivalent to one-way trip to Mars and still not receive a dose which exceedslifetime levels set up by NASA.</p>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.4) Who filmed Armstrong's first steps then?</h3>\r\n                <p>A video camera was fixed on an extending arm to the side of the lander.</p>\r\n                <p>But why wasn't the surface that the Lander made contact with disturbed??!?!</p>\r\n                <p>According to conspiracy theorists the power from the lunar module should have left a large impact crater under the lunar module.\r\n                    Firstly the lunar module was descending at an angle flying over the lunar landscape, as it is one sixth of the earth's gravity it requires one sixth less power/trust to fly over the surface.\r\n                    In addition the lunar module flying in at an angle meant it was not hovering over the same spot for more than a fraction of a second.\r\n                    Further, just before touch down the lunar module was operating at 25% of its power.\r\n                    This 25% power was subjected to the landing site for about half a second at most, which was enough to disturb the landing site slightly, as you can see in the photographs, but not as much as conspiracy theorists would have you believe.\r\n                </p>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.5) But we haven't we been back for 40 years?!</h3>\r\n                <p>Some people get suspicious for the fact that we haven't gone back to The Moon in over 40 years.\r\n                    NASA announced that they didn't want to be spending any more money on visiting The Moon as it's extremely expensive to constantly visit The Moon.\r\n                    Maybe NASA are running out of astronauts to send over there? Maybe NASA are saving up money for a future Mars landing? (Curiosity).\r\n                    Another way to put this is by saying 'I used to travel to Kazakhstan every year to ski.

Not only due to his technical ability on the 12-string guitar, but the quantity of output since the 70's to present day is actually insane.\r\n                He has quickly become one of my favourite jazz musicians ever due to his unique sound.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                One of his earlier albums 'Blue Sun' in 1982 has been in heavy rotation ever since I heard it... literally a few weeks ago...\r\n                I'm still in the process of absorbing every crevice of this album and all of the cosmic beauty it offers to listeners who are intrigued by the style.\r\n                This is unequivocally one of the best musical discoveries that I have made this year.\r\n                Needless to say I'm quite excited to exploring more Ralph Towner albums.

Personally I love it.\r\n                As is apparent from the fact that the song Flight is one of my most listened this year.\r\n                Highly recommend listening to the entire album, espcially this song.\r\n                The music video that goes along with the video is quite a delightful visual experience too, with it's spooky settings in the middle of nowhere and black & white footage.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/muNLqPPTuDQ?si=D96-lTTg_w_urv26\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track8'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#8</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>23 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>Rumpistol - I Rum Sø</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Another absolute maserpiece in terms of acquiring a unique/peaceful/mealncholic vibe.\r\n                Rumpistol has been around for a while in the IDM scene.\r\n                I personally perefer is recent endeavours in ambient/modern classical genres.\r\n                I only discovered this artist this year due to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheWonkyAngle\">TheWonkyAngle</a>'s review of the album, and couldn't be more greatful for it.\r\n                Defintely gets a place in my top 150 albums of all time list.\r\n                This song I Rum Sø is the first song on the album.

October 2020, I was not using LastFM to get scrobbling stats :(</p>\r\n            <p>However, due to the wonderful modern world we live in, there is an insane app called <a href=\"https://stats.fm/\">stats.fm</a> that is able to investigate your spotify listening history, and tell your what your most listened songs/albums/artists are over a specific time period (plus a lot of delicious stats to gaze at).\r\n                I started using spotify in 2017, so I technically have the equivalant of LastFM scrobbling stats for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020... This was an unexpected twist.</p>\r\n            <p>So, in this blog post I will go over the 25 songs that I listened to most in the year of our lord and saviour, <b>2020</b>...</p>\r\n            <p>I did the same for <a href='https://nimpod.github.io/nathansteele/#/blog/my_most_listened_songs_of_2014_2015_2016' target='_blank'>2014/15/16</a> too.</p>\r\n            <p className='note'>Disclaimer: this is <b>NOT a 'top 25 songs of 2020 list'</b>, this is simply <b>a list of the '25 songs that I listened to most throughout 2020'.</b> \r\n                It would be a waste of time messing about with arbitary ordering, when the quantitative measurement of a 'play count' already exists thanks to LastFM scrobbling!\r\n                I personally don't see the point of making 'top 25 songs of 2020' lists, or 'top 50 albums of 2020' lists, when you are bound to change your opinion on the arbitary ordering in a few months,\r\n                not to mention how much music is out there that you've never heard before and will inevitably discover several years down the line leaving your old lists outdated.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track1'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#1</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>30 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>Ichiko Aoba - いきのこり●ぼくら</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                This is the first Ichiko Aoba song that I got addicted to...

It is everything I expected a Ichiko Aoba music video to be.\r\n                According to stats.fm this is my 2nd most scrobbled song of all time, at 76 scrobbles....!

I'm not entirely sure how much music I actually listened to during this period in my life, but based on the play counts that I can see on itunes it looks like <b>a lot</b>... Although ironically my exploration of genres was far more limited back then than it is nowadays.</p>\r\n            <p>In this blog post I will go over the 32 songs that I listened to most between May 2014 - January 2017.</p>\r\n            <p>For context, I experienced the lovely ages of 17-18-19 through 2014-2015-2016, so these top 32 songs in some way reflect my... state of mind during this time period in my late teens.</p>\r\n            <p className='note'>Disclaimer: this is <b>NOT a 'top songs of 2014 list'</b>, this is simply <b>a list of the 'songs that I listened to most throughout 2014/2015/2016'. </b> \r\n                It would be a waste of time messing about with arbitary ordering, when the quantitative measurement of a 'play count' already exists thanks to LastFM scrobbling!\r\n                I personally don't see the point of making 'top songs of 2014' lists, or 'top albums of 2014' lists, when you are bound to change your opinion on the arbitary ordering in a few months,\r\n                not to mention how much music is out there that you've never heard before and will inevitably discover several years down the line leaving your old lists outdated.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track1'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#1</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>153 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>Oskar Schuster - Matilda</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Well, this was a pleasant suprise. Oskar Schuster's wonderful piano ballad 'Matilda' was apparently the song that I listened to most during this 2.5 year time period, by quite a signficiant margin too (1st place = 153 scrobbles, 2nd place = 103 scrobbles).\r\n                I still listen to Oskar Schuster's music to this day. Some of albums are in my all time favourites list.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Compared to the rest of this list, this is a suprisingly tame and well-disciplined musical choice. Well done past Nathan, good music taste... It's all downhill from here...\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J712_dwLL2g?si=D-V2bMF0QO9I5rK7\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track2'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#2</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>104 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>PVRIS - Smoke</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                There was once a time when I was really this Pop-punk/Synthpop/Alt-rock/Dance-punk band called PVRIS.\r\n                To be fair, 8 years later, I can kind of still see the appeal, but I think I have grown out of it now and doesn't really bring me the same level of joy as I remember it once doing. It appealed to a certain audience at the time that's for sure.\r\n                104 scrobbles for this song is pretty wild though.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxyEwNE5QSs?si=lwcEDh97C6vsXQYv\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track3'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#3</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>97 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>PVRIS - Mirrors</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Another song from PVRIS's 2014 album 'White Noise'.\r\n                Similar feelings to #2 apply to this one.
