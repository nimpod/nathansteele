Review content:
One of the things that makes this album so entertaining to listen to (and Poppy as an artist in general) is the contrast from cute pop moments, to aggressive alt-metal. It's unique and very distinctive, introducing a bit of spice into the well-trodden genres.

Within a few weeks of discovering this album back in early 2021, I was absolutely hooked. I was convinced this was a full on alt-metal masterpiece.
A few years later (writing this in 2024) and unfortuantly a few songs on the album don't hit the same as they used to.
I still love the album and rate it highly, but it's no longer in my top 10 albums of all time as it was for at least 2 years (2021 and 2022).
It happens to everyone, our taste changes over time. 

[02] I Disagree, and [04] Anything Like Me, are still brilliant songs.

The music video for [04] Anything Like Me is pretty fantastic, a piece of art:
