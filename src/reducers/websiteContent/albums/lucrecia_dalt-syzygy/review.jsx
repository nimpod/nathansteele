                A delectable medley of layered minimalist soundscapes. There's something so mysterious and detailed about this album. Every time I listen to this album I feel like I'm uncovering new things about it - a musical onion enigma. The sound expressed on this album is kinda like a abstract version of Air..... With trilingual vocals..... And surrealistic tropical interludes.... and hypnotising sub-bass drones.... There are few forgettable tracks, but its mostly a great album.
