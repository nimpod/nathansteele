                Boards of Canada (aka. BOC) are a highly mysterious ambient/downtempo/IDM/electronic group hailing from Scotland.
                In the year of 1998 they released their 2nd album Music Has The Right to Children, what I would say is unequivocally my favourite album of all time.
                Their style appeals to my personal taste in many ways, most notably...
                <ul>
                    <li>The marriage of futurism and nostalgia</li>
                    <li>The balance between melancholia and happiness</li>
                    <li>A reminder that life is a fleeting cosmic miracle and that one day humanity will cease to exist</li>
                    <li>An ethereal/mysterious/creepy/surreal/cosmic/atmospheric vibe</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I first discovered BoC in 2017 on a YouTube trip-hop mix that included the song "Julie and Candy", one of my favourite songs ever on their 2002 album "Geogaddi". 
                Upon listening to the mix many times, this one song stood out to me. It was different from any other style of music I'd heard it before.
                Pretty quickly I started going through their discography, and while all of their albums are very special, something about this 1998 album was and still is the most unique/engaging/otherworldly album I have ever experienced.

                Truly the greatest album of all time. The marriage of futurism and nostalgia is unlike any album I have ever heard.
                The balance between melancolia and happienss is perfect.
                It has an ethereal/mysterious/creepy/surreal/cosmic/atmospheric vibe like no other album.
                And to me it is a reminder that life is a fleeting cosmic miracle, and that one day humanity will cease to exist.
