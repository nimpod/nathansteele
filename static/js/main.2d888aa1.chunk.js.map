Given the technology available at the time, and the extremely\r\n                hostile conditions on Venus, the fact that we got any data back, let alone pictures and audio recordings from another planet, is a remarkable <b>feat of engineering\r\n                and science</b>.

It's not sci-fi, it's real, and I believe the Russians deserve more love and respect for\r\n                their engineering and discoveries. This precious data remains one of the most profound realizations of extreme environments on other planets - one of only 6 worlds we have successfully\r\n                placed landers on (Venus (1966), our Moon (1969), Mars (1976), Titan (2004), P67 comet (2015)).</p>\r\n            <p>Whilst it's entirely speculative, Venus may once have been Earth-like. Perhaps 300 million years ago Venus could have had similar conditions to current Earth. Perhaps the fate of future\r\n                Earth is similar to that of Venus's scorching hellscape - covered in volcanos, inconceivably high surface temperatures, and an almost impenetrable atmosphere polluted with\r\n                carbon dioxide - in other words, <b>climate change</b>.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://universemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/800px-PIA23791-Venus-NewlyProcessedView-20200608.jpg\" alt='Aphrodite Terra, a complex terrain' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-references references-text' id='section14'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>References</h3>\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li><a href='https://medium.com/@hunterscott/what-a-soviet-spacecraft-on-venus-can-teach-you-about-failure-f74f9c970a45'>https://medium.com/@hunterscott/what-a-soviet-spacecraft-on-venus-can-teach-you-about-failure-f74f9c970a45</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/venera.html'>https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/venera.html</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ecm4N0NLYI&list=PL_m58L0UBc3Vk3-_HNEHtt64cn1-aNpnJ&index=4'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ecm4N0NLYI&list=PL_m58L0UBc3Vk3-_HNEHtt64cn1-aNpnJ&index=4</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5pXx_AjjlM&list=PL_m58L0UBc3Vk3-_HNEHtt64cn1-aNpnJ&index=34&t=426s'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5pXx_AjjlM&list=PL_m58L0UBc3Vk3-_HNEHtt64cn1-aNpnJ&index=34&t=426s</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztmu__xo-vI&list=PL_m58L0UBc3Vk3-_HNEHtt64cn1-aNpnJ&index=24'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztmu__xo-vI&list=PL_m58L0UBc3Vk3-_HNEHtt64cn1-aNpnJ&index=24</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3Ife6iBdsU&list=PL_m58L0UBc3Vk3-_HNEHtt64cn1-aNpnJ&index=99'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3Ife6iBdsU&list=PL_m58L0UBc3Vk3-_HNEHtt64cn1-aNpnJ&index=99</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.space.com/18551-venera-13.html'>https://www.space.com/18551-venera-13.html</a></li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const review = (screenshots) => (\r\n    <div className='review-content'>\r\n        <div className=\"review-meRambling\">\r\n            <p className=\"review-section-subtitle\"># me rambling</p>\r\n            <p>Arrietty is a film about growing up and beginning your own exploration of the world, but is also a film about discovering new ways of living, integrating humanity with nature, finding positives out of negatives, and generally about the ever-changing perspectives of life and how that evolves as you gather more life experience.</p>\r\n            <p>It never resorted to petty narrative cliches despite so many opportunities to do so (like many U-rated animation films these days).</p>\r\n            <p>Explores similar themes to Kikis Delivery Service (a young mind venturing out into a big scary world), except with Arrietty the world is literally massive, and the characters are tiny!</p>\r\n            <img src={screenshots[0]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n            <p>Ontop of all the thematic depth and character development, the whole experience of the film is like a beutiful moving painting, every frame looks amazing.

and remained active for another 13 years, with the mission ending in dramatic fashion in <b>2017</b>.\r\n                The spacecraft made many profound discoveries, completely changing our

the mission was the lander, which touched down on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)'>Titan</a> (the largest of Saturn's 83 moons) on July 1st 2004, shortly after the spacecraft arrived at Saturn.</p>\r\n            <p>Remarkably, we have <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svmGxFaGILY'>video footage</a> of the lander descending for onto the surface of Titan for 2h 27m!!!! The image shown below is a screenshot of that slow descent.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"500\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svmGxFaGILY/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt='Screenshot of video footage showing Huygens descending' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <p>The Huygens probe landed just off the easternmost tip of a region called Adiri. Adiri is packed with lakes and islands.</p>\r\n            <p>When the spacecraft landed, it felt the surface as similar to a slightly more absorbent, sludgy mud texture... This is a photograph Huygens took when it landed!!!!</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"200\" height=\"100\" className='dont-resize' alt='Surface of Titan' src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Huygens_surface_color_sr.jpg/200px-Huygens_surface_color_sr.jpg\" />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <h5 className='subgroup-title'>What is it like on Titan?</h5>\r\n            <p><b>Extremely cold</b> - the Titanian lakes are estimated to be around <b>-179°C</b>...</p> \r\n            <p>These lakes are <b>not</b> comprised of liquid water like on Earth, but rather <b>hydrocarbon fluids (i.e. lakes of liquid methane/ethane!)</b> It's estimated that Titan contains about 300 times the volume\r\n                of Earth's proven oil reserves.</p>\r\n            <p>It also <b>rains liquid methane</b>. Organic compounds are produced by ultraviolet radiation in the atmosphere, and the rain deposits all these compounds onto the surface forming the lakes. There is no reason\r\n                why complex organic chemistry that gives rise to bacterial life could not emerge in this atmosphere.</p>\r\n            <p>Titan is thought to be a prebiotic environment rich in complex organic chemistry. It has been suggested that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water. \r\n                Such organisms would inhale H2 in place of O2, metabolize it with acetylene instead of glucose, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.</p>\r\n            <p>Titan is also home to cryovolcanoes, which also contribute to adding methane to the atmosphere.</p>\r\n            <p>On Titan, the little sunlight it gets allows only about one centimeter of evaporation per year (versus one meter of water on Earth), but the atmosphere can hold the equivalent of about 10 meters of liquid before rain \r\n                forms (versus about 2 cm on Earth). So Titan's weather is expected to feature downpours of several meters causing flash floods, interspersed by decades or centuries of drought (whereas typical weather on Earth\r\n                includes a little rain most weeks). Cassini has observed equatorial rainstorms only once since 2004. Despite this, a number of long-standing tropical hydrocarbon lakes were unexpectedly discovered in 2012.\r\n                This may explain the reason for the strange reappearance and disappearance of small islands which Cassini saw happening.</p>\r\n            <p>Huygens Titan lander remains the most distant landing of any human made spacecraft EVER.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://aasnova.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/fig1-7.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Titan\" />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <h5 className='subgroup-title'>Returning to Titan?</h5>\r\n            <p>There has been a mission proposed called the <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/content/titan-submarine-exploring-the-depths-of-kraken/'>Titan Mare Explorer</a> to send a submarine-like lander to investigate these mysterious Titanian lakes in more detail.</p> \\\r\n            <p>The lake of particular interest is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_Mare'>Kraken Mare</a>.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"300\" height=\"400\" className='dont-resize' src=\"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/638a3d6abc51bdee9320296e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200\" alt='Titan imaged by the James Webb Space Telescope' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <h5 className='subgroup-title'>The far future of Titan</h5> \r\n            <p>Unfortunately it's probably too cold on the surface for life as we know it to emerge. Titan-specific life could potentially evolve to work with the cold temperatures on Titan, but it's an unknown...</p>\r\n            <p>However, what about when the Sun expands into a red giant? Suddenly, Titan will start receiving much more heat and won't be as cold!</p>\r\n            <p>Temperatures could potentially be high enough to melt the ice mountains, allowing liquid water to flow into the liquid methane lakes which would of evaporated due to heat. The building blocks for DNA, RNA, proteins and cells could form. These chemical reactions could one day give rise to unique complex life.</p>\\\r\n            <p>In other words, Titan will become an Earth-like oasis when the Sun is dying. Our Earth will be long gone, but perhaps Titan will be the place to be when it goes supernova.</p>\r\n            <p>This Earth-like period could last anywhere between 100,000,000 - 500,000,000 years. Possibly not long enough for intelligent life to emerge, but long enough for some life to develop.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dpNszjv28a6t8x3krC7JXT.jpg\" alt='Map of Titan' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='section3'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>Enceladus</h3>\r\n            <p>The Cassini spacecraft continued exploring Saturn and its many fascinating moons, one of them being <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus'>Enceladus</a>, a majestic/mysterious/fascinating/terrifying world of unknowns.</p>\r\n            <p>Whilst orbiting the icy moon came the spacecraft came extremely close to <a href='https://phys.org/news/2015-04-icy-tendrils-saturn-source.html'>geyser tendrils</a> bursting jets of icy particles from Enceladus's south polar region at speeds of 1,360mph.</p>\r\n            <p>The geysers shoot out water vapor, other volatiles, and solid material, including sodium chloride crystals and ice particles, into space, totaling approximately 200 kilograms (440 lb) per second.

Luckily, Enceladus has a rocky core, meaning geothermal reactions like the ones in Earth's oceans are likely happening as we speak.</p>\r\n            <p>This makes Enceladus the most likely candidate for extra terrestrial life in our solar system.

No man-made spacecraft had ever attempted\r\n                this before, and we got some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJOnOPHFvo\">incredible photos</a> from this final phase of the mission. NASA have also provided us with\r\n                <a href=\"https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/galleries/raw-images/\">thousands of raw images</a> from Cassini.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>Due to the spacecraft being <b>low on rocket fuel</b>, NASA decided Cassini must end its mission soon. They decided to send Cassini into Saturn's atmosphere, destroying the spacecraft in the process. This method was chosen because...</p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li>1) It is imperative to ensure protection and prevent biological contamination to any of the moons of Saturn thought to offer potential habitability.</li>\r\n                <li>2) It's a unique opportunity to gather data about Saturn's gravity and magnetic fields.</li>\r\n                <li>3) As I said, Cassini was low on rocket fuel.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n                When Cassini began it's grand finale and took its first dive into Saturn's atmosphere, it was 1900 miles above the top of Saturn's clouds, and was able to transmit stunning \r\n                images of Saturn's atmosphere.

Maybe NASA are saving up money for a future Mars landing? (Curiosity).\r\n                    Another way to put this is by saying 'I used to travel to Kazakhstan every year to ski.

largest moon in the Solar System.</p>\r\n            <p>The mysterious moon contains a <b>geothermally heated sub-surface ocean</b>, the moon is geologically active with cryovolcanoes meaning the surface is constantly reshaping, <b>geysers</b> are spewing out water vapor 8km above the surface, and frosty nitrogen snow covers the moons icy surface.</p>\r\n            <picture

We have observed the formation of nitrogen clouds 3km above the surface of Triton, they are likely the result of the cryovolcanism going on inside the moon.</p>\r\n            <p>A single Tritonian season lasts <b>40 Earth years</b>. When Voyager 1 flew past Triton in 1989, it was spring in the Northen hemisphere. 24 years later in the year 2023,\r\n                it's now summer in the Northen hemisphere. In the depths of Tritonian winter, temperatures plunge to a rather <b>chilly temperature of -240°C</b></p>\r\n            <p>The surface is believed to be about 50% nitrogen snow, 33% water ice, the rest being frozen carbon dioxide (suspiciously similar to Pluto's surface... we'll get back to this later...).\r\n                There are no obvious signs of impact craters on the surface, but smooth plains of shiny nitrogen snow, vast landscapes of frozen cryovolcanoes, ridges formed by outpouring\r\n                of icy lava. All these observations have lead us to believe the moon is remarkably young (by the standards of our solar system - possibly a meagre 10 million years old!)\r\n                which would indicate that the surface is being endlessly reshaped by geological activity.</p>\r\n            <p>But the secrets behind Triton's mysterious geological activity may lie in its unusual orbit...</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/04/multimedia/out-there-ice-moon/out-there-ice-moon-superJumbo.jpg\" alt='' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='section3'>\r\n            <p>Remember I mentioned that Triton's surface is very similar to Pluto's? Well this may be no coincidence, as it's very likely Triton began as a <b>dwarf planet billions of years ago\r\n                in the Kuiper Belt alongside Pluto</b>. Neptune's strong gravitational pull captured Triton, claiming it as it's moon.</p>\r\n            <p>The most compelling evidence we have of this is <b>Triton's unusual orbit</b>. Neptune turns counter-clockwise, which means all of its moons should orbit in the same\r\n                direction - we have hundreds of pieces of evidence showing us this how most normal moons behave. Triton breaks this rule, orbiting in the opposite direction to its planet.\r\n                This is what we call a <b>Retrograde Orbit</b>.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/pia23874-1041.jpg\" alt='' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-references references-text ' id='section14'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>References</h3>\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGy4uyHVUYA'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGy4uyHVUYA</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzcNH9HHwrE'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzcNH9HHwrE</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwkjIgGqbFo'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwkjIgGqbFo</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JTkaXfPr0U'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JTkaXfPr0U</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkwq5Wkkdm4'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkwq5Wkkdm4</a></li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const post = (screenshots) => (\r\n    <div>\r\n        <ul className=\"messiahs-handbook\">\r\n            <li>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-str\">\"When you are faced with the possibility of an early death, it makes you realise that there are lots of things you want to do before your life is over.\"</p>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-person\">Stephen Hawking</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-str\">\"Most people are never going to die because they're never going to be born.\"</p>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-person\">Richard Dawkins</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-str\">\"Action expresses priorities.\"</p>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-person\">Gandhi</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-str\">\"When you are faced with the possibility of an early death, it makes you realise that there are lots of things you want to do before your life is over.\"</p>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-person\">Stephen Hawking</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-str\">\"Either we are alone in the Universe or we are not.

The musical language of this album is an ethereal/mysterious/nostalgic/creepy/surreal fusion of IDM, Ambient, Downtempo, and Trip Hop, that is uniquely Boards of Canada. </p>\r\n            <p>I first heard of the Scottish electronic duo Boards of Canada in 2017 on a YouTube trip hop mix that included the song \"Julie and Candy\", one of my favourite songs ever on their 2002 album \"Geogaddi\". Whilst listening to this mix several times, this one song stood out to me, it was different from any other style of music I'd heard it before, it was dense and atmospheric and creepy. Eventually I decided to delve deeper into the discography of Boards of Canada, and everything changed when I stumbled upon their 1998 album \"Music Has The Right To Children\". </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='review-favTracks'>\r\n            <p className=\"review-section-subtitle\"># favourite tracks</p>\r\n            <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1XZdwzd8DTDvkjVc0eJ9BI?utm_source=generator&theme=0\" \r\n                title=\"Spotify\"\r\n                width=\"100%\" \r\n                height=\"152\" \r\n                frameBorder=\"0\" \r\n                allowFullScreen=\"\" \r\n                allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" \r\n                loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const review = () => (\r\n    <div className='review-content'>\r\n        <div className=\"review-meRambling\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                Why the fuck are more people not listening to this. Japanese tsugaru-jamisen musician Chisato Yamanda created one of the best fusions of Japanese funk and Min'yō music I've ever heard in my life! This is so fucking underrated and underappreciated in the modern era! \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                This album is authentically Japanese and incredibly unique in its combination of genres and instrumentaiton - Shamisen (plucked string instrument), grand orchestral production, funky shamisen jams, the sound of wind. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The Third Movement, The Fourth Movement, and Tsugaru Spring Song is legitmatley one of my favourite 3 track runs in any album, EVER!!! Tsugaru Spring Song in particular is amazing. And the epic harmonised vocals being introduced at in the Third Movement begins this amazing run of musical splendour. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                There's a wonderful sense of musicianship that I sense whenever I listen to this album. Everything just works. I have rarely any criticims of this album, I think almost every song flow perfectly and the variety of instrumentation is a delectable splendour you should give your ears the chance. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Honestly the only song I'm a bit meh on is The First Movement, the intro to the album. But this is because the album develops at its own pace, gradually introducing new layers of instrumentation and production, which is part of its charm in my opinion. \r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const review = () => (\r\n    <div className='review-content'>\r\n        <div className=\"review-meRambling\">\r\n            <p>\r\n            Truly one of the most grandiose, epic, uplifting musical experiences of my life. \r\n            Every song absolutley bangs, flows perfectly, and as an album experience it just all feels so cohesive and well-crafted. \r\n            Solitaire is undoubetley one of the weaker tracks on the album, but its not bad, better than most acoustic tracks you find on any other prog album in my opinion. \r\n            It will forever baffle me why more people don't adore this album as much as I do. \r\n            Shame they had to go and ruin that with the shitty 'remaster' in 2018 with no Benoît David.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","/**\n * This RootReducer JS file is essentially a shite database.\n */\n\nimport { get_album_review_id, get_film_review_id } from '../js/helpers.js';\n\n// data...\nimport { blog_posts as localdata_blog } from './localData/blog_posts.js';\nimport { film_reviews as localdata_films } from './localData/film_reviews.js';\nimport { album_reviews as localdata_albums } from './localData/album_reviews.js';\n\n// retrieve web film data...\nlet webdata_top_films = require(`../components/films/webdata_top_films_list.json`);\nlet webdata_top_tracks = require(`../components/music/webdata_top_tracks_list.json`);\nlet webdata_top_albums = require(`../components/music/webdata_top_albums_list.json`);\n\n\n/**\n * Initial state\n */\nconst init_state = {\n    posts: localdata_blog,\n    top_films: localdata_films,\n    top_albums: localdata_albums,\n    top_tracks: webdata_top_tracks,\n}\n\n\n/**\n * Actual database...\n * @param {*} state \n * @param {*} action \n * @returns \n */\nconst RootReducer = (state=init_state, action) => {\n    // merge local & web data...\n    state.top_films = merge_films_data(\n        init_state.top_films,       // local data (my review, my rating, etc...)\n        webdata_top_films           // web data (genres, year, poster, etc...)\n    );\n    \n    // merge local & web data...\n    state.top_albums = merge_albums_data(\n        init_state.top_albums,      // local data (my review, my rating, etc...)\n        webdata_top_albums          // web data (genres, year, album cover, etc...)\n    );\n\n    // top tracks (no local data being stored, just web data)\n    state.top_tracks = init_state.top_tracks;\n\n    // return modified state...\n    return state;\n}\n\n\n/**\n * Merge local data & web data\n * @param {Local representation of top films list} local_data \n * @param {Online representation of top films list} web_data \n * @returns \n */\nconst merge_films_data = (local_data, web_data) => {\n    // retrieve local film data...\n    const mapped_by_id = (local_data.reduce((acc, film) => {\n        acc[film.letterboxd_url] = film;\n        return acc;\n    }, {}));\n\n    // merge local & web film data...\n    const merged_data = web_data.map(film => ({...film, ...mapped_by_id[film.letterboxd_url]}))\n\n    // add new attributes...\n    Object.entries(merged_data).forEach(([k,v]) => {\n        // calculate imdb diff score for each film...\n        v[\"IMDB_diff_score\"] = (v[\"my_rating\"] - v[\"IMDB_avg_rating\"]).toFixed(1)\n\n        // calculate average of gradual interest array...\n        if (v[\"gradual_interest\"] !== undefined) {\n            let arr = v[\"gradual_interest\"];\n            v[\"gradual_interest_average\"] = (arr.reduce((x,y) => x+y) / arr.length).toFixed(1);\n        }\n        \n        // find id of next/previous films\n        //let current_film = merged_data[v[\"position\"] - 1];
