            Absolutely savage, sadly relatable in its most introspective moments, chaotic in ways I didn't know were possible, very memorable despite its short runtime, and so much more! I really hope Poppy continue with this sound in future albums. What she created here in just 14 minutes is phenomenal and far more memorable and aggressive than most Alternative Metal albums out there.
