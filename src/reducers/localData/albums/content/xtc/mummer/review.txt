Review main section:
- My favourite XTC album, and also one of my favourite albums of all time. So many highlights.
- From the lovely ambient moments on [02] Wonderland, and [11] Frost Circus, to the strange pagan/tribal/ritualistic vibes on [01] Beating of Hearts, and [06] Human Alchemy, to the catchy [07] Ladybird, and [13] Toys, or the more acoustic moments on [03] Love On A Farmboys Wages, and [16] Desert Island.
- There isn't a single bad song on the album. Every song explores a different style. For me, this is XTC at their best.

- [13] Toys is possibly my favourite XTC song of all time:

- Great Fire is also a great tune, here's a clip of the band performing an acoustic version on some quirky looking 80s tv show:
