            <p>My absolute favourite album of all time. The musical language of this album is an ethereal/mysterious/nostalgic/creepy/surreal fusion of IDM, Ambient, Downtempo, and Trip Hop, that is uniquely Boards of Canada. </p>
            <p>I first heard of the Scottish electronic duo Boards of Canada in 2017 on a YouTube trip hop mix that included the song "Julie and Candy", one of my favourite songs ever on their 2002 album "Geogaddi". Whilst listening to this mix several times, this one song stood out to me, it was different from any other style of music I'd heard it before, it was dense and atmospheric and creepy. Eventually I decided to delve deeper into the discography of Boards of Canada, and everything changed when I stumbled upon their 1998 album "Music Has The Right To Children". </p>
