Review brief intro:
- Jesus Molina is a very talented pianist from Colombia.
- This album is one of the most underrated jazz albums of all time. This album deserves so much more attention it's unbelievable.
- It crosses all spectrums of emotions, it's not just an onslaught of energetic chaos like many classic fusion records. I believe "variety is the spice of life". This album has quiet, melancholic, contemplative moments to balance the energetic moments. This contrast is the key to me enjoying this album so much. Every song is so different, I hear different things every time I put it on.
- The production is impeccable, Jesus's playing is constantly engaging, 
- Discovered this album through GeorgeX's (https://rateyourmusic.com/music-review/GeorgeX/jesus-molina/agape/113547882) wonderful review.
- The album's name "Agape" (pronounced a-gay-pe) means to be in surprise or wonder - which is exactly how I feel every time I put this album on.
