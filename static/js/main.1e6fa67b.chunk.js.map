It gathered data from the hottest planet in the entire solar system (475°C), <b>a lonely world that once only knew the sound of wind and rain and volcanoes\r\n                until one day a strange machine landed and started taking pictures and drilling holes</b>. It's not sci-fi, it's real, and I believe the Russians deserve more love and respect for\r\n                their engineering and discoveries. This precious data remains one of the most profound realizations of extreme environments on other planets - one of only 6 worlds we have successfully\r\n                placed landers on (Venus (1966), our Moon (1969), Mars (1976), Titan (2004), P67 comet (2015)).</p>\r\n            <p>Whilst it's entirely speculative, Venus may once have been Earth-like. Perhaps 300 million years ago Venus could have had similar conditions to current Earth. Perhaps the fate of future\r\n                Earth is similar to that of Venus's scorching hellscape - covered in volcanos, inconceivably high surface temperatures, and an almost impenetrable atmosphere polluted with\r\n                carbon dioxide - in other words, <b>climate change</b>.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"200\"

me rambling</p>\r\n            <p>Arrietty is a film about growing up and beginning your own exploration of the world, but is also a film about discovering new ways of living, integrating humanity with nature, finding positives out of negatives, and generally about the ever-changing perspectives of life and how that evolves as you gather more life experience.</p>\r\n            <p>It never resorted to petty narrative cliches despite so many opportunities to do so (like many U-rated animation films these days).</p>\r\n            <p>Explores similar themes to Kikis Delivery Service (a young mind venturing out into a big scary world), except with Arrietty the world is literally massive, and the characters are tiny!</p>\r\n            <img src={screenshots[0]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n            <p>Ontop of all the thematic depth and character development, the whole experience of the film is like a beutiful moving painting, every frame looks amazing. It doesn't look like it was generated by an AI but clearly has a lot of attention to detail and rich in colour. Even the cinematography was amazing, really emphasing the difference in size and perspectives.</p>\r\n            <p>Asks questions about how humanity can become more integrated with nature, instead of fighting it for our own selfish needs. It did this without seeming preachy, but rather compassionate and thought-provoking (similar thoughts to Nausicaa).</p>\r\n            <p>The idea of loads of little human creatures creating their own tiny habitats inside the walls of a house, a world that looks so magical when you're inside it, but so tiny and insignificant when seeing it from their perspective. And this is obviously real! Think about how much wildlife exists just in your garden! So many interesting stories about nature, and how our existence can either harm them or benefit them.</p>\r\n            <img src={screenshots[1]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"review-synopsis\">\r\n            <p class=\"review-section-subtitle\"># brief synopsis</p>\r\n            <p>A family of tiny people live anonymously in another family's residence, borrowing simple items to make their home.

It made me think about what impact my life may have in the far future. How will people remember me? \r\n                Will I be forgotten in amongst billions of others? What unbelievable cosmic events will I miss out on outside of my lifetime? I believe that we should not feel small, \r\n                insignificant, unimportant or pointless.

Perhaps if there were more of a gradual instrumental progression (like Ritual) it could have been even better. \r\n                But the simple melody, the subtle instrumentation, the way its used, when it's used in scenes, is all done so wonderfully. It wouldn't have been the same film without it.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>They even got Mamoru Oshii on this film!?!? If there's any film I didn't expect the legendary anime director to randomly appear on as a supporting actor, it was definitely this one!</p>\r\n            <p>The cinematography wasn't the most

watch, the more I realise how good they are at creating characters because they feel so real.\r\n                I guess this is the combination of the actors ability to say a lot without saying much, the actors ability to understand the character based on the director's advice, \r\n                and the actors ability to understand the original script's intention of the character.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>Creating a complex character seems to be a pillar of filmmaking that the Japanese understand very well.</p>\r\n            <p>Generally, if like me your life is full of

the mission was the lander, which touched down on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)'>Titan</a> (the largest of Saturn's 83 moons) on July 1st 2004, shortly after the spacecraft arrived at Saturn.</p>\r\n            <p>Remarkably, we have <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svmGxFaGILY'>video footage</a> of the lander descending for onto the surface of Titan for 2h 27m!!!! The image shown below is a screenshot of that slow descent.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"500\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svmGxFaGILY/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt='Screenshot of video footage showing Huygens descending' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <p>The Huygens probe landed just off the easternmost tip of a region called Adiri. Adiri is packed with lakes and islands.</p>\r\n            <p>When the spacecraft landed, it felt the surface as similar to a slightly more absorbent, sludgy mud texture... This is a photograph Huygens took when it landed!!!!</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"200\" height=\"100\" className='dont-resize' src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Huygens_surface_color_sr.jpg/200px-Huygens_surface_color_sr.jpg\" alt='Photo taken of Titan surface' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <h5 className='subgroup-title'>What is it like on Titan?</h5>\r\n            <p><b>Extremely cold</b> - the Titanian lakes are estimated to be around <b>-179°C</b>...</p> \r\n            <p>These lakes are <b>not</b> comprised of liquid water like on Earth, but rather <b>hydrocarbon fluids (i.e. lakes of liquid methane/ethane!)</b> It's estimated that Titan contains about 300 times the volume\r\n                of Earth's proven oil reserves.</p>\r\n            <p>It also <b>rains liquid methane</b>. Organic compounds are produced by ultraviolet radiation in the atmosphere, and the rain deposits all these compounds onto the surface forming the lakes. There is no reason\r\n                why complex organic chemistry that gives rise to bacterial life could not emerge in this atmosphere.</p>\r\n            <p>Titan is thought to be a prebiotic environment rich in complex organic chemistry. It has been suggested that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water. \r\n                Such organisms would inhale H2 in place of O2, metabolize it with acetylene instead of glucose, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.</p>\r\n            <p>Titan is also home to cryovolcanoes, which also contribute to adding methane to the atmosphere.</p>\r\n            <p>On Titan, the little sunlight it gets allows only about one centimeter of evaporation per year (versus one meter of water on Earth), but the atmosphere can hold the equivalent of about 10 meters of liquid before rain \r\n                forms (versus about 2 cm on Earth). So Titan's weather is expected to feature downpours of several meters causing flash floods, interspersed by decades or centuries of drought (whereas typical weather on Earth\r\n                includes a little rain most weeks). Cassini has observed equatorial rainstorms only once since 2004. Despite this, a number of long-standing tropical hydrocarbon lakes were unexpectedly discovered in 2012.\r\n                This may explain the reason for the strange reappearance and disappearance of small islands which Cassini saw happening.</p>\r\n            <p>Huygens Titan lander remains the most distant landing of any human made spacecraft EVER.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://aasnova.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/fig1-7.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Titan\" />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <h5 className='subgroup-title'>Returning to Titan?</h5>\r\n            <p>There has been a mission proposed called the <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/content/titan-submarine-exploring-the-depths-of-kraken/'>Titan Mare Explorer</a> to send a submarine-like lander to investigate these mysterious Titanian lakes in more detail.</p> \\\r\n            <p>The lake of particular interest is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_Mare'>Kraken Mare</a>.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"300\" height=\"400\" className='dont-resize' src=\"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/638a3d6abc51bdee9320296e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200\" alt='Photo of Titan taken by the James Webb Space Telescope' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <h5 className='subgroup-title'>The far future of Titan</h5> \r\n            <p>Unfortunately it's probably too cold on the surface for life as we know it to emerge. Titan-specific life could potentially evolve to work with the cold temperatures on Titan, but it's an unknown...</p>\r\n            <p>However, what about when the Sun expands into a red giant? Suddenly, Titan will start receiving much more heat and won't be as cold!</p>\r\n            <p>Temperatures could potentially be high enough to melt the ice mountains, allowing liquid water to flow into the liquid methane lakes which would of evaporated due to heat. The building blocks for DNA, RNA, proteins and cells could form. These chemical reactions could one day give rise to unique complex life.</p>\\\r\n            <p>In other words, Titan will become an Earth-like oasis when the Sun is dying. Our Earth will be long gone, but perhaps Titan will be the place to be when it goes supernova.</p>\r\n            <p>This Earth-like period could last anywhere between 100,000,000 - 500,000,000 years.

No man-made spacecraft had ever attempted\r\n                this before, and we got some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJOnOPHFvo\">incredible photos</a> from this final phase of the mission.

Maybe NASA are saving up money for a future Mars landing? (Curiosity).\r\n                    Another way to put this is by saying 'I used to travel to Kazakhstan every year to ski.

largest moon in the Solar System.</p>\r\n            <p>The mysterious moon contains a <b>geothermally heated sub-surface ocean</b>, the moon is geologically active with cryovolcanoes meaning the surface is constantly reshaping, <b>geysers</b> are spewing out water vapor 8km above the surface, and frosty nitrogen snow covers the moons icy surface.</p>\r\n            <picture

We have observed the formation of nitrogen clouds 3km above the surface of Triton, they are likely the result of the cryovolcanism going on inside the moon.</p>\r\n            <p>A single Tritonian season lasts <b>40 Earth years</b>. When Voyager 1 flew past Triton in 1989, it was spring in the Northen hemisphere. 24 years later in the year 2023,\r\n                it's now summer in the Northen hemisphere. In the depths of Tritonian winter, temperatures plunge to a rather <b>chilly temperature of -240°C</b></p>\r\n            <p>The surface is believed to be about 50% nitrogen snow, 33% water ice, the rest being frozen carbon dioxide (suspiciously similar to Pluto's surface... we'll get back to this later...).\r\n                There are no obvious signs of impact craters on the surface, but smooth plains of shiny nitrogen snow, vast landscapes of frozen cryovolcanoes, ridges formed by outpouring\r\n                of icy lava. All these observations have lead us to believe the moon is remarkably young (by the standards of our solar system - possibly a meagre 10 million years old!)\r\n                which would indicate that the surface is being endlessly reshaped by geological activity.</p>\r\n            <p>But the secrets behind Triton's mysterious geological activity may lie in its unusual orbit...</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/04/multimedia/out-there-ice-moon/out-there-ice-moon-superJumbo.jpg\" alt='' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='section3'>\r\n            <p>Remember I mentioned that Triton's surface is very similar to Pluto's? Well this may be no coincidence, as it's very likely Triton began as a <b>dwarf planet billions of years ago\r\n                in the Kuiper Belt alongside Pluto</b>. Neptune's strong gravitational pull captured Triton, claiming it as it's moon.</p>\r\n            <p>The most compelling evidence we have of this is <b>Triton's unusual orbit</b>. Neptune turns counter-clockwise, which means all of its moons should orbit in the same\r\n                direction - we have hundreds of pieces of evidence showing us this how most normal moons behave. Triton breaks this rule, orbiting in the opposite direction to its planet.\r\n                This is what we call a <b>Retrograde Orbit</b>.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/pia23874-1041.jpg\" alt='' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-references references-text ' id='section14'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>References</h3>\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGy4uyHVUYA'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGy4uyHVUYA</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzcNH9HHwrE'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzcNH9HHwrE</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwkjIgGqbFo'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwkjIgGqbFo</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JTkaXfPr0U'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JTkaXfPr0U</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkwq5Wkkdm4'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkwq5Wkkdm4</a></li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const post = (screenshots) => (\r\n    <div>\r\n        <ul className=\"messiahs-handbook\">\r\n            <li>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-str\">\"When you are faced with the possibility of an early death, it makes you realise that there are lots of things you want to do before your life is over.\"</p>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-person\">Stephen Hawking</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-str\">\"Most people are never going to die because they're never going to be born.\"</p>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-person\">Richard Dawkins</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-str\">\"Action expresses priorities.\"</p>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-person\">Gandhi</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-str\">\"When you are faced with the possibility of an early death, it makes you realise that there are lots of things you want to do before your life is over.\"</p>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-person\">Stephen Hawking</p>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <p className=\"quote-str\">\"Either we are alone in the Universe or we are not.
