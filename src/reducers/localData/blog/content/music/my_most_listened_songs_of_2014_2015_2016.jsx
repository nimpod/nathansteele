            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>Intro</h3>
            <p>This is a 'pre-spotify' time period where I was using my ipod to listen to music for several years. I'm not entirely sure how much music I actually listened to during this period in my life, but based on the play counts that I can see on itunes it looks like <b>a lot</b>... Although ironically my exploration of genres was far more limited back then than it is nowadays.</p>
            <p>In this blog post I will go over the 32 songs that I listened to most between May 2014 - January 2017.</p>
            <p>For context, I experienced the lovely ages of 17-18-19 through 2014-2015-2016, so these top 32 songs in some way reflect my... state of mind during this time period in my late teens.</p>
            <p className='note'>Disclaimer: this is <b>NOT a 'top songs of 2014 list'</b>, this is simply <b>a list of the 'songs that I listened to most throughout 2014/2015/2016'. </b> 
                It would be a waste of time messing about with arbitary ordering, when the quantitative measurement of a 'play count' already exists thanks to LastFM scrobbling!
                I personally don't see the point of making 'top songs of 2014' lists, or 'top albums of 2014' lists, when you are bound to change your opinion on the arbitary ordering in a few months,
                not to mention how much music is out there that you've never heard before and will inevitably discover several years down the line leaving your old lists outdated.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Well, this was a pleasant suprise. Oskar Schuster's wonderful piano ballad 'Matilda' was apparently the song that I listened to most during this 2.5 year time period, by quite a signficiant margin too (1st place = 153 scrobbles, 2nd place = 103 scrobbles).
                I still listen to Oskar Schuster's music to this day. Some of albums are in my all time favourites list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Compared to the rest of this list, this is a suprisingly tame and well-disciplined musical choice. Well done past Nathan, good music taste... It's all downhill from here...

            <p>
                There was once a time when I was really this Pop-punk/Synthpop/Alt-rock/Dance-punk band called PVRIS.
                To be fair, 8 years later, I can kind of still see the appeal, but I think I have grown out of it now and doesn't really bring me the same level of joy as I remember it once doing. It appealed to a certain audience at the time that's for sure.
                104 scrobbles for this song is pretty wild though.

                Another song from PVRIS's 2014 album 'White Noise'.
                Similar feelings to #2 apply to this one. Doesn't quite excite me in the same way it once did.

            <p>
                I was really into Enter Shikari back in the day. The album this track is from (Take To The Skies) was definitely one of my favourite albums back then.
                There is something about the gritty/anthemic/passionate/extravagant style that still excites me today.
                It's a youthful sound of Screamo/Post-hardcore/Metalcore/Emo-pop that appealed to a certain generation of angsty teenagers.

                Ah indeed, my early ventures into classical piano music began around 2014.
                Quite a stark contrast to the other music I was listening to at this time.

                Back in 2016 I was really into Logic.
                I'm not as big of a fan these days, but I do have a lot of nostalgia for particular songs.
                This isn't really one of his best songs, but quite nostalgic for me.
                In retrospect it's very pleasant listenable pop rap, that I probably shouldn't have listened to 86 times.

                More very pleasant listenable pop rap from Logic.

                Another extravagant song from Enter Shikari's debut album 'Take To The Skies' was on heavy rotation on my ipod.

                Yes I did have good music taste back in 2016!
                I remeber vividly the day I discovered this song, and thus Boards of Canada.
                I was listening to a trip-hop/chillout/downtempo YouTube playlist, and when this song came on my brainwaves were suddenly synced with the music.
                At that point there was no turning back with Boards of Canada. I still listen to this song and their many obscure side-projects 7 years later.

                I used to be a big fan of this Nu-metal band called 'Issues'.
                One song in particular I remember loving was this collab with female UK rapper 'Snow Tha Product'.
                This particular vibe doesn't really appeal to me anymore. It improves a lot around the 3:30 mark when we start hearing some spooky ambient noise and then Snow Tha Product starts rapping.

                Persnally, 'The Mindsweep' was always my favourite Shikari album. It has a slightly more mature and developed quality to it that I still enjoy to this day.
                This song in particular is still absolute fucking fire. One of the best fusions of (Drum & Bass) + (Alt-metal) + (A bit of a hip hop vibe) + (A political message) songs ever in my opinion.

                This particular vibe that Lily Allen was exploring in the mid-2000s has in my opinion, never been replicated in quite the same way.
                The instantly recognisable combination of (Reggae pop) + (Sunshine Pop) + (R&B) + (Britishness) still remains unique today.
                There are so many pop bangers in this album it's crazy. 
                Unfortuantly, this song 'Smile' is overplayed a lot nowadays in pop-culture and media, but the Deluxe version of this album contains a plethora of energetic timeless bangers to explore. There's a lot more depth to the sound of this album than this individual song represents.

            <p>
                Vangoffey are a fairly obscure Indie-rock/Brit-pop band from the UK.
                I barely remembered this song when I saw it in the list, but as soon as the bassline hit all the memories came flooding back.
                It's actually a really solid indie rock tune with a lot of energy and charisma, deserves more attention.

            <p>
                I was a big fan of Emo-pop/Post-hardccore/Pop-punk/Alt-rock band Brand New back in 2015.
                In particular the album this song is from 'Deja Entendu' I was loving at the time.
                I don't quite love the songs from this album as much as I used to, but I can still see the appeal (it's angsty, dark, rebellious, angry, depressing, etc...)

                Ah my good friend Logic it's been a while.
                To be honest, there are much better Logic songs in his 'Under Pressure' album, and 'Undeniable' mixtape.
                I'm not quite sure what I saw in this song to listen to it 71 times... But there we go...

                I was a massive massive fan of this song, the album 'Thats The Spirit', and BMTH in general around 2015/2016.
                I definitely still see the appeal, but I think I've grown out of it a bit.
                Still a very fun album to listen to. I've had the album down as a 10/10 for years, if I'm in the right frame of mind it probably is still a personal favourite of Alt-rock/Alt-metal/Pop-rock/Post-hardcore

            <p>
                It seems apt to conclude this list with a Radiohead song.
                During the wonderful summer of 2016, I was only just discovering Radiohead due to their new album at the time 'A Moon Shaped Pool', an album that I still absolutely love and rate very highly.
                Discovering Radiohead was a kind of transition phase for me in terms of branching out to new genres.
                It looks like I listened to this song a lot before my ipod died on me in late 2016 :(
