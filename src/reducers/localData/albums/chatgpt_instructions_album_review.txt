Convert the following text into HTML code. Please obide by these rules:
1) Do not apply any CSS code. 
2) Apply the <a> links appropriately to the related text above it.
3) Do NOT use <ul> tags (apart from the track ratings section).
4) Do NOT encapsulate a track reference around an anchor tag. For example do not change [4] Anything Like Me, to <a href="#">Anything Like Me</a>. Instead, I would simply like you to encapsulate it around <strong></strong>


Divide each section into <div> block elements:
1) There should be 4 sections, please divide them up into indivudual div blocks with appropriate classnames.
2) Change the first div block to <div className="review-artistIntro">
3) Change the first div block to <div className="review-content">
4) Change the first div block to <div className="review-trackRatings">
5) Change the first div block to <div className="review-summary"

6) Encapsulate all this content within the "review-content" div block (as shown in the code snippet below) please keep the import statement and export statement.

    import React from 'react';

    export const review = () => (
        <div className='review-content'>
        </div>
    )

And a few more modifications if you don't mind:
7) Remove the 'export default review' line at the bottom.
8) For the 'artistIntro' section, feel free to refine what I have written about the artist. But don't make it too complex.
9) Remove any headings that you created at the beginning of each <div> block.
10) Remove and <br> tags that you inserted into the code.


11) Convert the content inside "review-trackRatings" into a JSON object that is of the same strucutre as the JSON shown below.
   Make the JSON data a variable, and place it in the .jsx file we have been previously working on.
    
    const tracklist = [
        { "rating": 9, "title": "DT" },
        { "rating": 11, "title": "Magic Mirror Mayhem!" },
        { "rating": 10, "title": "1,000,001 MOLA" },
        { "rating": 11, "title": "Meter Workbench" },
        { "rating": 8, "title": "Endless Higabana" },
    ]


8) In the "review-trackRatings", replace all content inside the div with the following line:
    <TemplateTracklistComponent tracklist={tracklist} />

9) Add the following import statement to the top of the .jsx file:
    import TemplateTracklistComponent from '../../../TemplateTracklistComponent.jsx';
