Review main section:
- There was once a time when this album was among my top 10 of all time.
- I still respect the album a lot, but I don't feel quite the same love for it anymore.
- From track 6 to 10, are some my favourite examples of the Nu Metal genre, very maximalist.

- [07] By Myself, and [10] Forgotten, are absolute tunes. It's a shame they didn't get official music videos, but this is great live performance:

- The music video for [02] One Step Closer is pretty wild:

- The music video for [04] Points of Authority really captures the energy of the era well:

- I actually think the first 5 songs on the album, despite being by far more popular, are some of the less exciting on the album.
- I'm also not the biggest fan of [13] My December.
