            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>1.1) The Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment</h3>
                <p>Reflectors were placed on the moon at just the right angle so that a laser can be fired from earth to the moon, which then bounces off these reflectors and back to the earth at the exact point it left.</p>
                <p>This is done with pin-point accuracy and is still in operation today. Many countries including Russia use the reflectors placed on the moon to conduct their own experiments.</p>
                <p>This was part of The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment'>Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment</a></p>

            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>1.2) Lunar rocks</h3>
                <p>Buzz Aldrin collected 16 <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rock'>Moon Rocks</a> and brought them back to Earth to examine. Once they were returned, there was still 16 rocks, and they were all legit.</p>
                <p>Many other missions have brought Moon rocks and have all been similar to Apollo 11's rocks and are all carbon dated and documented to their landing dates.</p>
                <p>We have brought back 350kg lunar rock on the Apollo missions.</p>
                <p>The rocks we've brought back date to about 3,900 million years old.</p>
                <p>The oldest natural glass on earth that has been found pales in comparison at just 160 million years. This is due to the atmospheric decay of glass on earth.</p>
                <p>The moon has no atmosphere, so glass does not decay the same way.</p>
                <p>These lunar glass balls have been tested throughout the world by numerous scientists.</p>

            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>1.4) Limitations of camreas in the 60's</h3>
                <p>Cameras and films in 1969 were very different to present day.</p>
                <p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_loUDS4c3Cs&list=PL_m58L0UBc3Vk3-_HNEHtt64cn1-aNpnJ&index=123'>A very informative video</a> goes into a lot of detail</p>
            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>1.5) Worldwide research and publicity</h3>
                <p>In order for NASA to fake The Moon Landing, around 400,000 people would of had to keep it a secret, for almost 50 YEARS... really? </p>
                <p>You think 400,000 scientific researchers around the world are gonna create an incredibly elaborate 'movie set' just so they can say they went to The Moon?</p>
            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>1.6) Conspiracy theorists are crazy</h3>
                <p>The person who created this ridiculous conspiracy theory is this drug addict called Bill Kaysing.</p>
                <p>He was always having illucinations about travelling to The moon and being humiliated in front of people in his dreams.</p>
                <p>He then then spread the rumour around to the public.</p>
        </div>
        <div className='blog-subsection' id='typical-questions'>
            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.1) Where are the stars?</h3>
                <p>One of the claims made to support the hoax theory is that there were no stars pictured from the surface of the Moon.</p>
                <p>The true reason you can't see the stars in photos and videos of Moon is not that the stars aren't there, but rather because of the omnipresent sunlight and the exposure limits of cameras.</p>
                <p>When these photos were taken, it was full daylight on the Moon. Because there is only an extremely thin atmosphere on the Moon,the sky appears black.</p>
                <p>In addition, sunlight at the Moon's surface was incomparably strong with the starlight; the stars simply faded in comparison with the sun.</p>
                <p>If the astronauts used sufficiently long exposures, stars would, indeed, be visible.</p>
                <p>There are no stars because the cameras couldn't pick them up. And like I mentioned before, considering that it is 1969, there are a lot of limitations on the ability to carry out documentation in the form of photo/video media.</p>
            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.2) But the flag is waving?</h3>
                <p>The flag was actually made from plastic material, similar to the one that tents are usually made of.</p>
                <p>For practical reasons, the flag was originally folded to maximize space and stored in a thin tube.</p>
                <p>After Neil Armstrong planted it to the surface of the Moon, it briefly appeared to move as it was unfolding itself to its final shape.</p>
                <p>I like to imagine the flag as tinfoil, try and make a nice flat piece of tinfoil!</p>
            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.3) But they passed through the Van Allen Radiation Belt?</h3>
                <p>The truth is, during their entire voyage to the Moon and back to Earth, Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins only received amount of radiation equal to about 0.1% of the deadly dose.</p>
                <p>Their total exposure was approximately 11 milisieverts. Lethal levels of radiation is around 8,000 millisieverts.</p>
                <p>The harmful effects of radiation are based both on its strength and the time of exposure to its source.</p>
                <p>Average human would need to spend nearly four months inside the Van Allen belts to accumulate a lethal dose.</p>
                <p>The astronauts managed to pass through them during less than one hour.</p>
                <p>Regarding the time spent out of Earth's magnetic field, where the astronauts were exposed to solar radiation, an average human could endure a radiation exposure equivalent to one-way trip to Mars and still not receive a dose which exceedslifetime levels set up by NASA.</p>
            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.4) Who filmed Armstrong's first steps then?</h3>
                <p>A video camera was fixed on an extending arm to the side of the lander.</p>
                <p>But why wasn't the surface that the Lander made contact with disturbed??!?!</p>
                <p>According to conspiracy theorists the power from the lunar module should have left a large impact crater under the lunar module.
                    Firstly the lunar module was descending at an angle flying over the lunar landscape, as it is one sixth of the earth's gravity it requires one sixth less power/trust to fly over the surface.
                    In addition the lunar module flying in at an angle meant it was not hovering over the same spot for more than a fraction of a second.
                    Further, just before touch down the lunar module was operating at 25% of its power.
                    This 25% power was subjected to the landing site for about half a second at most, which was enough to disturb the landing site slightly, as you can see in the photographs, but not as much as conspiracy theorists would have you believe.
                </p>
            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.5) But we haven't we been back for 40 years?!</h3>
                <p>Some people get suspicious for the fact that we haven't gone back to The Moon in over 40 years.
                    NASA announced that they didn't want to be spending any more money on visiting The Moon as it's extremely expensive to constantly visit The Moon.
                    Maybe NASA are running out of astronauts to send over there? Maybe NASA are saving up money for a future Mars landing? (Curiosity).
                    Another way to put this is by saying 'I used to travel to Kazakhstan every year to ski. Just because I don't go anymore, doesn't mean I never went.'
                </p>
            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>Summary</h3>
                <p>As you can see people love a good conspiracy theory, and perhaps some conspiracy theories are true, after all governments across the world have a large history of corruption and deception.
                    But it's the idea of faking the moon landings is just too big to be a hoax.
                    Too many people and competing countries are involved, and all the points conspiracy theorists make are easily explained.
                    The first point I made about the Lunar laser ranging experiment is something that could not have been set up any other way than by going to the moon and placing reflectors in exact positions on the lunar surface.
                    It's a piece of evidence that one simply can-not ignore.
                    When people get an idea into their head sometimes they can identify with it so much that it becomes their identity.
                    They then do everything they can to defend this identity even in the face of irrefutable evidence.
                </p>
                <p>Isn't it nice though to look at the evidence and see that actually, we did go to the moon!
                    What an amazing achievement that was in bringing humanity together as one, towards a common goal.
                    That's what space exploration and the International Space Station is really all about, to show that we are a whole species much more similar than we are different, and that instead of wasting all this energy competing with one another we should move forward together, out into the cosmos.
