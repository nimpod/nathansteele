            Super intense fusion of hardcore breakbeat + glitch + jungle + ambient. Combine this album with indoor cycling and your mind (and body) will explode into a million tiny frivolous pieces. For my taste this is almost a perfect combination of my favourite genres. Not every song is perfect, and I think the last few songs that are more ambient focussed aren't that engaging, but the ones that bang fucking bang.
