However, this track, and their new album, I found to be quite enjoyable. Despite the runtime for this track being a whopping 19 minutes, somehow I stil listened to it 20 times this year! So I spent 6 hours listening to this... However it's an unbelievably mesmerising experience, again I think this was the kind of mood I was in this year, long moody melancholic drone ambient tracks."

        "thoughts_p2": "Anyway, Celer is an ambient artist I only just started listening to this year, I am a big fan of this album 'Xiexie', the context behind the albums creation is intriguing, and somehow every time I listen to the album time flies by, espcially for this 10 minute track. Maybe in a few years time I'll look back on this and wonder what the hell was wrong with me, finding peace and calm in this kind of drone music, but for now I do find genuine clarity and comfort from this style."
