Review intro:
- For a long time, I considered this album as a 10/10, a perfect album.
- Recently, I have been thinking about what actually makes for a perfect album.
- Personally, this album for me is a complete album experience, I can listen to the entire album skipping a song along the way. Every song feels part of the journey this album takes you on.
- However, some tracks in isolation (mostly the interlude-type tracks) would not make sense outside of the context of the full album.
- But for me they don't diminish the album experience. They just add to the distinctive vibe of the album.
- As the name of the album would suggest, there are 35 songs on the album. And for that reason I haven't rated every song. Just my favourites.
- A few songs in particular, are absolutely transcendental.
- For example, A05 - Finity, what a beauty of a song. To pair it with visuals is a great experience too:

- A06 is a beautiful track:

- A13 has a very grand vibe to it:

- B07 is a very curious little tune, great quirky vibe:

- B09 is another very quirky little banger:

- I could keep going on for a while. As you can see, there's a lot to uncover from this album.
