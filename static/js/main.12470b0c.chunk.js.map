growing up and beginning your own exploration of the world, but is also a film about discovering new ways of living, integrating humanity with nature, finding positives out of negatives, and generally about the ever-changing perspectives of life and how that evolves as you gather more life experience.</p>\r\n            <p>It never resorted to petty narrative cliches despite so many opportunities to do so (like many U-rated animation films these days).</p>\r\n            <p>Explores similar themes to Kikis Delivery Service (a young mind venturing out into a big scary world), except with

character development, the whole experience of the film is like a beutiful moving painting, every frame looks amazing. It doesn't look like it was generated by an AI but clearly has a lot of attention to detail and rich in colour. Even the cinematography was amazing, really emphasing the difference in size and perspectives.</p>\r\n            <p>Asks questions about how humanity can become more integrated with nature, instead of fighting it for our own selfish needs. It did this without seeming preachy, but rather compassionate and thought-provoking (similar thoughts to Nausicaa).</p>\r\n            <p>The idea of loads of little human creatures creating their own tiny habitats inside the walls of a house, a world that looks so magical when you're inside it, but so tiny and insignificant when seeing it from their perspective. And this is obviously real! Think about how much wildlife exists just in your garden!

What unbelievable cosmic events will I miss out on outside of my lifetime? I believe that we should not feel small, \r\n                insignificant, unimportant or pointless.

Absolutely essential viewing if you are interested in <b>astronomy</b>, <b>spirituality</b>, the <b>mysteries of the ocean</b>, \r\n                the <b>origins of life</b>, the <b>universe</b>, and combining all of that with <b>unique stylish visual art</b>.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>It's great to see such intriguing audio-visual experiences tackle subject matters larger than life, exploring the unknown, things beyond human comprehension. \r\n                This film is a wonderful form of creative expression, that speaks openly about the incomprehensible vastness of life and the mysterious universe that\r\n                we have the luck, technology, and time to explore for a brief amount of its existence and an even briefer amount of our existence.\r\n                This film is a cautionary tale of curiosity, forgiveness, ikigai, personal awakenings, and cosmic self-awareness.</p>\r\n            <p>As with many Japanese films, the dialogue and (voice) acting is very expressive. Due to this, it's absolutely essential that you watch this in \r\n                Japanese with subtitles in your native language, and not with dubbed audio. This can be challenging with a film like this as there is a \r\n                lot thrown at the viewer, but it's essential if you want to feel immersed in the full audio-visual-linguistic experience.</p>\r\n            <p>If you are interested in stylish visual art, cosmology, the mysteries of the ocean, and the origins of the Universe, this is an absolute must watch.</p>\r\n            <img src={screenshots[0]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='review-subratings'>\r\n            <p className='review-section-subtitle'># rating each aspect of the film</p>\r\n            <p><b>Art style (10/10)</b> - This is one of the most visually original, intense, polarising animation styles I have ever seen, \r\n                thanks to the very forward-thinking animation studio <a href=\"https://www.studio4c.co.jp/english/\">Studio 4°C</a>.</p>\r\n            <p><b>Cinematography (10/10)</b> - The depth and scale of the cinematography in the ocean was huge. \r\n                This creates an interesting contrast compared to the vast incomprehensible scale of the Universe, \r\n                since we have imaged a lot more of this space we constantly spin and whiz through, in comparison to the oceans all around us that are too dark, \r\n                inhabitable, vast, and difficult to study to the same level of detail.</p>\r\n            <p><b>Narrative (10/10)</b> - Philosophical musings on the mysteries of the universe and the ocean is an easy way to win me over in film, \r\n                and this film executes it to perfection. Some may argue that the first 30 mins are a bit tame and unremarkable, \r\n                and while that's partly true it sets the scene perfectly and I think it retains enough mystery to keep the viewer engaged.</p>\r\n            <p><b>Soundtrack (9/10)</b> - Joe Hisaishi created another spectacular soundtrack. Several songs are absolutely transendental, \r\n                a few are middling and not overly memorable but doesn't affect how I feel about the film, merely my rating to the soundtrack itself -\r\n                nevertheless, the melodies and atmosphere the soundtrack emits has stuck with me ever since I watche this film, and is absolutely intergral to developing the atmosphere, tension, and cosmic self-awareness.</p>\r\n            <img src={screenshots[1]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"review-synopsis\">\r\n            <p className=\"review-section-subtitle\"># brief synopsis</p>\r\n            <p><b>Brief synopsis</b> - \r\n                Ruka has just finished school and endless months of summer are looming. \r\n                She feels bored and disconnected from her classmates and life at home.\r\n                She longs for solitude, friendship, and a greater purpose in life, and finds it at a local aquarium where she encounters a strange boy who has adapted to living in the ocean, and is undergoing experiments at the aquarium to prolong his short lifespan.\r\n                The deep dark mysteries of the ocean slowly unravel, and Ruka undergoes an aquatic awakening, revealing the cosmos in its vast beauty.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <img src={screenshots[2]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const review = (screenshots) => (\r\n    <div className='review-content'>\r\n        <div className=\"review-meRambling\">\r\n            <img src={screenshots[0]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n            <img src={screenshots[1]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"review-synopsis\">\r\n            <img src={screenshots[2]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const review = (screenshots) => (\r\n    <div className='review-content'>\r\n        <div className=\"review-meRambling\">\r\n            <img src={screenshots[0]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n            <img src={screenshots[1]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n            <img src={screenshots[2]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const review = (screenshots) => (\r\n    <div className='review-content'>\r\n        <div className=\"review-meRambling\">\r\n            <img src={screenshots[0]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n            <img src={screenshots[1]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n            <img src={screenshots[2]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"review-synopsis\">\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const review = (screenshots) => (\r\n    <div className='review-content'>\r\n        <div className=\"review-meRambling\">\r\n            <img src={screenshots[0]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n            <img src={screenshots[1]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"review-synopsis\">\r\n            <img src={screenshots[2]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React  from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const review = (screenshots) => (\r\n    <div className='review-content'>\r\n        <div className=\"review-meRambling\">\r\n            <p className=\"review-section-subtitle\"># me rambling</p>\r\n            <p>I am rarely so enamored by a film that is centered entirely on 2 people, but the chemistry between them is just so infectious and authentic. \r\n                I found the first half of this film to be addictively gentle and brimming with genuine passion, joy, and inspiration. \r\n                I could have watched another 10 hours of them just chatting about anime and books and just hanging out.\r\n                The chemistry between these two characters was just off the charts. \r\n                The fusion of their personal interests made it so clear they were soulmates.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>Considering this, the second half of this film was a difficult punch to take, but a very intentional descent into the depressing realization that relationships often don't work out, \r\n                because hobbies and work often take separate paths when youngsters begin trying to earn a living.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <img src={screenshots[0]} alt=\"Screenshot from film\" />\r\n            <p>I loved the soundtrack.

The musical language of this album is an ethereal/mysterious/nostalgic/creepy/surreal fusion of IDM, Ambient, Downtempo, and Trip Hop, that is uniquely Boards of Canada. </p>\r\n            <p>I first heard of the Scottish electronic duo Boards of Canada in 2017 on a YouTube trip hop mix that included the song \"Julie and Candy\", one of my favourite songs ever on their 2002 album \"Geogaddi\". Whilst listening to this mix several times, this one song stood out to me, it was different from any other style of music I'd heard it before, it was dense and atmospheric and creepy. Eventually I decided to delve deeper into the discography of Boards of Canada, and everything changed when I stumbled upon their 1998 album \"Music Has The Right To Children\". </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*}\r\n        <div className='review-favTracks'>\r\n            <p className=\"review-section-subtitle\"># favourite tracks</p>\r\n            <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1XZdwzd8DTDvkjVc0eJ9BI?utm_source=generator&theme=0\" \r\n                title=\"Spotify\"\r\n                width=\"100%\" \r\n                height=\"152\" \r\n                frameBorder=\"0\" \r\n                allowFullScreen=\"\" \r\n                allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" \r\n                loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        */}\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const review = () => (\r\n    <div className='review-content'>\r\n        <div className=\"review-meRambling\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                Why the fuck are more people not listening to this. Japanese tsugaru-jamisen musician Chisato Yamanda created one of the best fusions of Japanese funk and Min'yō music I've ever heard in my life! This is so fucking underrated and underappreciated in the modern era! \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                This album is authentically Japanese and incredibly unique in its combination of genres and instrumentaiton - Shamisen (plucked string instrument), grand orchestral production, funky shamisen jams, the sound of wind. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The Third Movement, The Fourth Movement, and Tsugaru Spring Song is legitmatley one of my favourite 3 track runs in any album, EVER!!! Tsugaru Spring Song in particular is amazing. And the epic harmonised vocals being introduced at in the Third Movement begins this amazing run of musical splendour. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                There's a wonderful sense of musicianship that I sense whenever I listen to this album. Everything just works. I have rarely any criticims of this album, I think almost every song flow perfectly and the variety of instrumentation is a delectable splendour you should give your ears the chance. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Honestly the only song I'm a bit meh on is The First Movement, the intro to the album.

Organic compounds are produced by ultraviolet radiation in the atmosphere, and the rain deposits all these compounds onto the surface forming the lakes. There is no reason\r\n                why complex organic chemistry that gives rise to bacterial life could not emerge in this atmosphere.</p>\r\n            <p>Titan is thought to be a prebiotic environment rich in complex organic chemistry. It has been suggested that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water. \r\n                Such organisms would inhale H2 in place of O2, metabolize it with acetylene instead of glucose, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.</p>\r\n            <p>Titan is also home to cryovolcanoes, which also contribute to adding methane to the atmosphere.</p>\r\n            <p>On Titan, the little sunlight it gets allows only about one centimeter of evaporation per year (versus one meter of water on Earth), but the atmosphere can hold the equivalent of about 10 meters of liquid before rain \r\n                forms (versus about 2 cm on Earth). So Titan's weather is expected to feature downpours of several meters causing flash floods, interspersed by decades or centuries of drought (whereas typical weather on Earth\r\n                includes a little rain most weeks). Cassini has observed equatorial rainstorms only once since 2004. Despite this, a number of long-standing tropical hydrocarbon lakes were unexpectedly discovered in 2012.\r\n                This may explain the reason for the strange reappearance and disappearance of small islands which Cassini saw happening.</p>\r\n            <p>Huygens Titan lander remains the most distant landing of any human made spacecraft EVER.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src={IMAGES.titan_map} alt=\"Map of Titan\" />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <h5 className='subgroup-title'>Returning to Titan?</h5>\r\n            <p>There has been a mission proposed called the <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/content/titan-submarine-exploring-the-depths-of-kraken/'>Titan Mare Explorer</a> to send a submarine-like lander to investigate these mysterious Titanian lakes in more detail.</p>\r\n            <p>The lake of particular interest is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_Mare'>Kraken Mare</a>.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"300\" height=\"400\" className='dont-resize' src={IMAGES.jwst_photo_of_Titan} alt='Titan imaged by the James Webb Space Telescope' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <h5 className='subgroup-title'>The far future of Titan</h5> \r\n            <p>Unfortunately it's probably too cold on the surface for life as we know it to emerge.

Because there is only an extremely thin atmosphere on the Moon,the sky appears black.</p>\r\n                <p>In addition, sunlight at the Moon's surface was incomparably strong with the starlight; the stars simply faded in comparison with the sun.</p>\r\n                <p>If the astronauts used sufficiently long exposures, stars would, indeed, be visible.</p>\r\n                <p>There are no stars because the cameras couldn't pick them up. And like I mentioned before, considering that it is 1969, there are a lot of limitations on the ability to carry out documentation in the form of photo/video media.</p>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.2) But the flag is waving?</h3>\r\n                <p>The flag was actually made from plastic material, similar to the one that tents are usually made of.</p>\r\n                <p>For practical reasons, the flag was originally folded to maximize space and stored in a thin tube.</p>\r\n                <p>After Neil Armstrong planted it to the surface of the Moon, it briefly appeared to move as it was unfolding itself to its final shape.</p>\r\n                <p>I like to imagine the flag as tinfoil, try and make a nice flat piece of tinfoil!</p>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.3) But they passed through the Van Allen Radiation Belt?</h3>\r\n                <p>The truth is, during their entire voyage to the Moon and back to Earth, Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins only received amount of radiation equal to about 0.1% of the deadly dose.</p>\r\n                <p>Their total exposure was approximately 11 milisieverts. Lethal levels of radiation is around 8,000 millisieverts.</p>\r\n                <p>The harmful effects of radiation are based both on its strength and the time of exposure to its source.</p>\r\n                <p>Average human would need to spend nearly four months inside the Van Allen belts to accumulate a lethal dose.</p>\r\n                <p>The astronauts managed to pass through them during less than one hour.</p>\r\n                <p>Regarding the time spent out of Earth's magnetic field, where the astronauts were exposed to solar radiation, an average human could endure a radiation exposure equivalent to one-way trip to Mars and still not receive a dose which exceedslifetime levels set up by NASA.</p>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.4) Who filmed Armstrong's first steps then?</h3>\r\n                <p>A video camera was fixed on an extending arm to the side of the lander.</p>\r\n                <p>But why wasn't the surface that the Lander made contact with disturbed??!?!</p>\r\n                <p>According to conspiracy theorists the power from the lunar module should have left a large impact crater under the lunar module.\r\n                    Firstly the lunar module was descending at an angle flying over the lunar landscape, as it is one sixth of the earth's gravity it requires one sixth less power/trust to fly over the surface.\r\n                    In addition the lunar module flying in at an angle meant it was not hovering over the same spot for more than a fraction of a second.\r\n                    Further, just before touch down the lunar module was operating at 25% of its power.\r\n                    This 25% power was subjected to the landing site for about half a second at most, which was enough to disturb the landing site slightly, as you can see in the photographs, but not as much as conspiracy theorists would have you believe.\r\n                </p>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>2.5) But we haven't we been back for 40 years?!</h3>\r\n                <p>Some people get suspicious for the fact that we haven't gone back to The Moon in over 40 years.\r\n                    NASA announced that they didn't want to be spending any more money on visiting The Moon as it's extremely expensive to constantly visit The Moon.\r\n                    Maybe NASA are running out of astronauts to send over there? Maybe NASA are saving up money for a future Mars landing? (Curiosity).\r\n                    Another way to put this is by saying 'I used to travel to Kazakhstan every year to ski. Just because I don't go anymore, doesn't mean I never went.'\r\n                </p>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>Summary</h3>\r\n                <p>As you can see people love a good conspiracy theory, and perhaps some conspiracy theories are true, after all governments across the world have a large history of corruption and deception.\r\n                    But it's the idea of faking the moon landings is just too big to be a hoax.\r\n                    Too many people and competing countries are involved, and all the points conspiracy theorists make are easily explained.\r\n                    The first point I made about the Lunar laser ranging experiment is something that could not have been set up any other way than by going to the moon and placing reflectors in exact positions on the lunar surface.\r\n                    It's a piece of evidence that one simply can-not ignore.\r\n                    When people get an idea into their head sometimes they can identify with it so much that it becomes their identity.\r\n                    They then do everything they can to defend this identity even in the face of irrefutable evidence.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>Isn't it nice though to look at the evidence and see that actually, we did go to the moon!\r\n                    What an amazing achievement that was in bringing humanity together as one, towards a common goal.\r\n                    That's what space exploration and the International Space Station is really all about, to show that we are a whole species much more similar than we are different, and that instead of wasting all this energy competing with one another we should move forward together, out into the cosmos.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>Here is a beautiful diagram of all the (successfull) <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing'>moon landings on The Moon</a>:</p>\r\n                <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                    <img width=\"200\" height=\"100\" src={IMAGES.moon_landing_sites} alt=\"Map of all moon landings\" />\r\n                </picture>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection references-text' id='references'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>References</h3>\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/interactive-map-shows-all-21-successful-moon-landings-180972687/'>Cool interactive diagram of moon landings</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing'>Wikipedia, Moon Landing</a></li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst IMAGES = {\r\n    mini_dv_tape: require('./photos/mini_dv_tape.jpg'),\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const post = () => (\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div className='intro-text blog-subsection'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>What is a Mini DV Tape?</h3>\r\n            <p>A Mini DV tape is a type of cassette tape used in most <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camcorder'>digital camcorders</a> until the early 2000's.</p>\r\n            <p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DV'>Digital Video (DV)</a> is a format for storing digital videos, created by Sony, JVC, Panasonic and other video camera manufacturers in 1995.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"200\" className='dont-resize' src={IMAGES.mini_dv_tape} alt=\"Mini DV tape\" />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>Why do we need to digitize Mini DV tapes?</h3>\r\n            <p>In 2003, DV was joined by a successor format <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDV'>HDV</a>, which used the same tape format with a different video codec.

Triton breaks this rule, orbiting in the opposite direction to its planet.\r\n                This is what we call a <b>Retrograde Orbit</b>.</p>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src={IMAGES.unusual_orbit} alt='' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n            <picture className=\"img\">\r\n                <img width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src={IMAGES.surface2} alt='' />\r\n            </picture>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-references references-text ' id='section14'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>References</h3>\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGy4uyHVUYA'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGy4uyHVUYA</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzcNH9HHwrE'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzcNH9HHwrE</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwkjIgGqbFo'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwkjIgGqbFo</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JTkaXfPr0U'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JTkaXfPr0U</a></li>\r\n                <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkwq5Wkkdm4'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkwq5Wkkdm4</a></li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Link, withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nconst IMAGES = {\r\n    scrobbles_graph: require('./scrobbles_per_month_graph.PNG'),\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const post = () => (\r\n    <div className='my-most-listened-songs-of-this-year'>\r\n        <div className='intro-text blog-subsection' id='section1'>\r\n            <div className='display-img-beside-text'>\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <h3 className='subgroup-title'>Intro</h3>\r\n                    <p>2023 has probably been the most insane year so far in terms of personal musical discoveries. \r\n                        Unfortuantly I have discovered way more than 25 great songs this year...

Personally I love it.\r\n                As is apparent from the fact that the song Flight is one of my most listened this year.\r\n                Highly recommend listening to the entire album, espcially this song.\r\n                The music video that goes along with the video is quite a delightful visual experience too, with it's spooky settings in the middle of nowhere and black & white footage.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/muNLqPPTuDQ?si=D96-lTTg_w_urv26\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track8'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#8</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>23 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>Rumpistol - I Rum Sø</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Another absolute maserpiece in terms of acquiring a unique/peaceful/mealncholic vibe.\r\n                Rumpistol has been around for a while in the IDM scene.\r\n                I personally perefer is recent endeavours in ambient/modern classical genres.\r\n                I only discovered this artist this year due to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheWonkyAngle\">TheWonkyAngle</a>'s review of the album, and couldn't be more greatful for it.\r\n                Defintely gets a place in my top 150 albums of all time list.\r\n                This song I Rum Sø is the first song on the album.

Other weaker forces also have an effect (the Moon’s tilt, elliptical orbit, influence of the Sun).\r\n                    About 50 billion years from now, if the Moon and Earth could somehow avoid the eventual death of our Sun (~5 billion years from now), the Moon would be so far away and its orbit so large, that Earth would eventually tidally lock to the Moon... \r\n                    Only one side of the Earth would ever see the Moon, the other side moonless.\r\n                    Unfortunately, humanity will not bear witness to such distant events. So next time you look up at the Man in the Moon, remember the processes that keep it there, contemplate on other planets throughout the vast Universe where moons of different colours/shapes/sizes/orbits/terrain shine brightly on alien worlds, and reflect on our insignificant, fleeting, brief, fortunate existence at a time in the Universe where we are lucky enough to make observations of “nearby” stars, exo-solar-systems, galaxies, compared to the inevitable incomprehensibly large, dark, lonely fate of our Universe due to cosmic inflation and black hole dominance.\r\n

there is an insane app called <a href=\"https://stats.fm/\">stats.fm</a> that is able to investigate your spotify listening history, and tell your what your most listened songs/albums/artists are over a specific time period (plus a lot of delicious stats to gaze at).\r\n                I started using spotify in 2017, so I technically have the equivalant of LastFM scrobbling stats for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020...

It is everything I expected a Ichiko Aoba music video to be.\r\n                According to stats.fm this is my 2nd most scrobbled song of all time, at 76 scrobbles....!

Although ironically my exploration of genres was far more limited back then than it is nowadays.</p>\r\n            <p>In this blog post I will go over the 32 songs that I listened to most between May 2014 - January 2017.</p>\r\n            <p>For context, I experienced the lovely ages of 17-18-19 through 2014-2015-2016, so these top 32 songs in some way reflect my... state of mind during this time period in my late teens.</p>\r\n            <p className='note'>Disclaimer: this is <b>NOT a 'top songs of 2014 list'</b>, this is simply <b>a list of the 'songs that I listened to most throughout 2014/2015/2016'. </b> \r\n                It would be a waste of time messing about with arbitary ordering, when the quantitative measurement of a 'play count' already exists thanks to LastFM scrobbling!\r\n                I personally don't see the point of making 'top songs of 2014' lists, or 'top albums of 2014' lists, when you are bound to change your opinion on the arbitary ordering in a few months,\r\n                not to mention how much music is out there that you've never heard before and will inevitably discover several years down the line leaving your old lists outdated.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track1'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#1</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>153 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>Oskar Schuster - Matilda</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Well, this was a pleasant suprise. Oskar Schuster's wonderful piano ballad 'Matilda' was apparently the song that I listened to most during this 2.5 year time period, by quite a signficiant margin too (1st place = 153 scrobbles, 2nd place = 103 scrobbles).\r\n                I still listen to Oskar Schuster's music to this day. Some of albums are in my all time favourites list.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Compared to the rest of this list, this is a suprisingly tame and well-disciplined musical choice. Well done past Nathan, good music taste... It's all downhill from here...\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J712_dwLL2g?si=D-V2bMF0QO9I5rK7\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track2'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#2</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>104 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>PVRIS - Smoke</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                There was once a time when I was really this Pop-punk/Synthpop/Alt-rock/Dance-punk band called PVRIS.\r\n                To be fair, 8 years later, I can kind of still see the appeal, but I think I have grown out of it now and doesn't really bring me the same level of joy as I remember it once doing. It appealed to a certain audience at the time that's for sure.\r\n                104 scrobbles for this song is pretty wild though.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxyEwNE5QSs?si=lwcEDh97C6vsXQYv\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track3'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#3</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>97 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>PVRIS - Mirrors</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Another song from PVRIS's 2014 album 'White Noise'.\r\n                Similar feelings to #2 apply to this one.

The album this track is from (Take To The Skies) was definitely one of my favourite albums back then.\r\n                There is something about the gritty/anthemic/passionate/extravagant style that still excites me today.\r\n                It's a youthful sound of Screamo/Post-hardcore/Metalcore/Emo-pop that appealed to a certain generation of angsty teenagers.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H4h3lW8XGUY?si=LQi8DTrhEHVp4nu_\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track5'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#5</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>88 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>Chopin - Nocturne in B Major (Op. 32 No. 1)</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Ah indeed, my early ventures into classical piano music began around 2014.\r\n                Quite a stark contrast to the other music I was listening to at this time.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wqSUwG3euEY?si=Cbw5gDiW18vJhpYm\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track6'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#6</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>86 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>Logic - Lord Willin</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Back in 2016 I was really into Logic.\r\n                I'm not as big of a fan these days, but I do have a lot of nostalgia for particular songs.\r\n                This isn't really one of his best songs, but quite nostalgic for me.\r\n                In retrospect it's very pleasant listenable pop rap, that I probably shouldn't have listened to 86 times.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cqTrC1fEnUk?si=eI2Ocj9UzIUrMNgK\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track7'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#7</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>85 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>PVRIS - My House</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                More angsty Dance-punk from PVRIS.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aQz-aKvyQU?si=fejuVqM-HU8KI5S6\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='blog-subsection' id='track8'>\r\n            <h3 className='subgroup-title'>\r\n                <span className='track-pos'>#8</span>\r\n                <span className='track-scrobbles'>83 scrobbles</span>\r\n                <span className='track-artist-and-title'>Logic - Fade Away</span>\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n                More very pleasant listenable pop rap from Logic.\r\n                Again, if this was released nowadays I probably wouldn't think much of it.
