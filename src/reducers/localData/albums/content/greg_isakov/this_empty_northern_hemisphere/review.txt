Review main section:
- This whole album is just a very peaceful experience. There's a strong sense of melancholia throughout the songs.
- A few of the songs on this album are just okay. But there isn't a "bad" song on the album. The songwriting and quality is very consistent.
- Sometimes it's nice to take a break from complex/experimental/abstract music, and just reconnect to simplicity.

- My favourite tracks are [01] Dandelion Wine, [05] Virgina May, [07] Master and a Hound, [08] This Empty Northern Hemisphere.

- The music video for [05] Virgina May is very soothing:
